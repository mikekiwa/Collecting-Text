    "### Intro to Python for Social Sciencists\n",
    "\n",
    "In September of 2011, Science magazine printed an [article](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6051/1878) by Cornell sociologists Scott Golder and Michael Macy that examined how trends in positive and negative attitudes varied over the day and the week. To do this, they collected 500 million Tweets produced by more than two million people. They found fascinating daily and weekly patterns in attitudes. It’s a great example of the sort of interesting things social scientists can do with online social network data. More generally, the growth of “big data” presents social scientists with unique opportunities for researching old questions, along with empowering us to ask new questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Along with these new sources of data, social scienctists are also beginning to import new methods of analysis into their research program. This includes both novel ways of understanding texts, such as topic models, to complex methods for analzying quantitive data, such as ensemble methods like random forests. Traditional closed-source statistical packages, such as [Stata](http://www.stata.com), have been quite slow in adopting these new techniques. In contrasts, R users are much less disadvantaged, particluarly with new packages like [`rvest`](https://github.com/hadley/rvest) for web scraping and several sophisticated pacages for [text analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/index.html) and [machine learning](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/randomForest.pdf). That said, the linqu franca of computer science is Python, likely because the teach it in Stanford's CS 101 course. As such, there is a particularly well developed ecosytem for doing data science with Python with a particular strenght in the collection of data from the internet and the management and processing of text data. I wouldn't recommend a 1st year graduate student *only* learn Python, but I  think there is a tremendous advantage for quantitaitve analysists to be polyglots. There is likely to be a way to collect or analyze data that you can't do with your primary computer statistical package, and not knowing how to do it won't convince Reviewer 2 very well. "

    "This tutorial is designed to introduce social scientists to using Python. It does this by working through an example of how to collect and analyze data in the style of Golder and Macy's study. It assumes that the reader is general familiar with social science research, but has little to know experience with Python. Most Python texts are aimed at people who want to learn programming (historically, the only a small minority of Python users were data scientists), and the few that cover topics of interest to sociologists generally assume a computer science background."

In addition to Python (which you might already have on your computer), it bundles a couple of incredibluy useful things: a suite of libraries for doing data science; Jupyter for creating notebooks; and `conda` for installing additional packages. Prior to Anaconda, getting Python up and running for data science involved walking up hill in the snow both ways. \n",

    "This text is written using using [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org) which is a pretty nifty way to combine code and text. Assuming you have installed it through either of the above mechanism, you start iPython on a Mac by running Terminal and typing `jupyter notebook`. This will open up a browser window. From here, you can create, modify or run notebooks, which are stored with an `.ipynb` extension  (previously called IPython notebooks).  Pro-tip: a Google search for whatever you are trying to figure out plus `filetype:ipynb` will return only notebook results, which are often a great way to see code samples that might solve your problem.

    "Now, following Golder and Macy, we need to decide if this is a positive or negative opinion. If we had a large sample of the Tweets already coded by sentiment, would could try and figure out which words appeared more often in Tweets we considered positive, and which words appeared more often in Tweets we considered negative. In sociology, we might think about this in a regression framework. We want to predict whether the sentence is positive, negative, or neither, and we could use the presence or absence of words as predictors. In computer science, this would be considered a supervised learning classification problem. But we don’t have a sample precoded, so let’s save classification for another day.\n",

Looking back at the list of words that printed when we printed every word in our tweet might provide some clues as to why this occurred. While we have “awesome” in our positive words list, we don’t have “Awesome!!!” and Python is looking for an exact match. In order to get the two versions to match, we would need to make the “A” lower case and remove the exclamation marks. This is called pre-processing or cleaning the data. Shifting everything to lower case and stripping punctuation are the most common pre-processing tasks in natural language processing. Other common things to do are stemming words, which attempts to find the root of the word (e.g. “running” and “runs” both get reduced to “run”) and removing little words like “the”, “and”, or “if”, which are known as stop words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since removing capitalization and punctuation involves throwing away potentially meaningful variation, you should proceed with caution. For example, you might think that the “Awesome!!!” is different from “awesome”, that “WOW” is different from ”wow”, or that “Cool!” is different from “Cool?”. In the machine learning tradition (a set of techniques I will discuss in more detail at a later point), this is part of the art of “feature selection”. Social scientists have independent or explanatory variables that they use to explain their models, while computer scientists try to find the “features” with the most predictive power. In natural language processing, features can be more than the absence or presence of specific words. Word count, presence of parts of words, sentence complexity, use of the passive voice, presence of emoticons, or any other text attribute that can be expressed as a number can be included as a feature. I’m a fan of starting with just the words to get a baseline model, and then seeing if you can improve on it. And in this case, we don’t have punctuation or non-lower cases words coded in our list of emotional words, so the decision is made for us.\n",
