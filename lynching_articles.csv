I hope every reader of the Bugle, will re

shows how well acquainted men in other

WHY DID THE
Ministers the Town of Leeds
ABSENT THEMSELVES FROM THE
Anti-Slavery Meeting
ON THURSDAY EVENING LAST?
f
It is not perhaps known to all, that at the
meetings of the Anti-slavery League, held
in the Music Hall, Leeds, and addressed uy
Messrs. Douglass and Wriorht. there wag
not n sinale minister to be seen, except Mr,
... . . . ... . ... .-n
icksteed, the Unitarian minister oi nnii-
hill chapel. Mr. Wicksteed was present at
both meetings, and spoke at ooin , out ne
was alone in his glory. Not a Methodist
nor a Daptist, not an Independent nor s
Churchman, was there to keep him compa
ny. I am told that at other towns it has been
verv much the same. At Darlington an In
j ... . i . - j .. j
dependent minister, ftir. rrucnaru, ancnuuu,
but it was to oppose the abolitionists, and
defend the pro-slavery and slave-holding
churches and preachers. At Newcastle an
Independent minister attended ; but it was to
defend tho faithless Editor of the Christian
Witness, the traducer and calumniator of the
slaves' best friends. Generally speaking,
the orthodox ministers throughout the coun
try have kept aloof from the cause of aboli
tion. To such an extent has this been the
case, that George Thompson, at a meeting of
the League in one of our large towns, when
asked, 'Is this an anti-slavery meeting, or an
anti-clerical meeting V was obliged to an
swer, ' It is truly, and in good faith, a pure
ly anti-slavery meeting ; hut lam sorry to
say,' that such is tho position, and suc-h is tho
conduct of the clergy, than an anti-slavery
must now of necessity be an anti-clerical
meeting.'
The conduct of orthodox ministers in this
matter requires explanation. This explana
tion we atlcmpt to give. Many are asking,
Why were there no ministers at the meetings
at Leeds This question we attempt to an
swer. Whether our answer be the right one,
our readers must judge. We fear it is. We
grant that our answer condemns the minis
ters ; but we nave no nope mat uie ministers
will be able to prove that we have con
demned them unjustly. In a part of
this tract we speak as in the name, of the
ministers; but with no desire to do them
wrong. And we have no"" desire that our
answer to the question should be the only
one; if the ministry will answer tor them
selves, we shall bo glad to read their answer.
We have answered the question to llie nest
of our ability, and we hope that botli minis
ters and people w ill receive proht, it not plea
sure, from what we have written.
Why, then, did Ministers of the Town of
Leeds absent themselves from the Anti-Slavery
Meeting on Thursday evening last?

Ans. 1. It was not because they are in
favor of American Slavery. It was not be
cause they have any objection to tho aboli
tion of slavery. It was not because uiry
think that slavery is a natural or a happy
f tate for man. It was not because they think
that slavery in America is better than the
slavery once existing in the West India Is
lands, it was not because tney are wisinui
lo perpetuate slavery in America. On the
contrary, they would rejoice to see slavery
abolished. 1 hey would bo glad to see me
world entirely free from such an unnatural
and inhuman system. They regard slavery
as the greatest curse of humanity. They look
upon it as a mass ot crime, lliey believe
with John Wesley, that it is the grossest
outrane upon human nuhts mat can be per
netrated. the bitterest insult to a Human De-
iii rr that can be olfered, and the sum of all
possible villages. They are perfectly aware
thai slavery must necessarily be a system
cruelty that cruelty and slavery are insepa
rable. They are aware, that to subdue
spirit of a human being, to reduce him to
brute, and to hi mm to be useo as property,
the greatest cruelties imaginable are neces
sarv. Thev are aware that slavery is a sys
tem of stripes, ol cliains, oi letters, oi
yokes, of brandings, of maimings, of insults,
of indignities, of violence in every form,
of cruelty in every shape, they are aware
that slavery is inconsistent vvitn respect
the institution ot marriage, witn tne sacreu
ness of domestic relationship, with the vigour
and health of the benevolent affections,
with all the dear delights and joys of home,
of love, and household blessedness. They
are aware that slavery is a system of pollu
tion ; that where slavery prevails, woman
unprotected, and subject to every indecency
and outrage. They are aware that where
slavery prevails, the husband is torn from
wife at his master's pleasure, and the
torn from her husband ; that children are
from their parents, and parents
their children that beauty, and innocence,
and all the attractions of humanity, are bought
and sold, by selfish, sensual, brutal man
They are aware, that in me lamine oi
slave-holders, as well as in the huts of
slaves, the grossest licentiousness prevails,
and the most unnatural anominauon.
aro nol ijnoiant of tho fact, (hat the piobl
teresting portion of the human species, are
often reared and trained for the most inhu-
man and revolting purpose that the mind of
man can conceive. They are not even ig
norant of the fact, that where slavery pre
vails, the father often sells his own offspring,
and in some cases sells his offspring to the
u.uo. ,iu. nme ana unnatural doom lo which
a human being can he devoted. Then
also iware, that slavery is destructive to the
iineiemn oi morality in general. They know
that it hardens the heart of the Blave-holder,
and makes the injured slave reckless and
desptrate. They know that it increases
men 8 selfishness ; that it withers the very
root cf benevolence, and makes the heart of
the master as hard and unfeeling as a stone.
They know that absolute power was never
meant for man, and that no man can possess
it without risk or ruin lo his virtue and his
humanity. They know that to deal in the
blood and flesh, in the bodies and souls of
their brethren that to seize and make mer
chandise of those whom God has formed for
intelligence, and virtue, -and immortality,
muBt necessarily strike at the root of all that
is good, of all that is great, of all that is ten
der, of all that is god-like, of all that is love
ly, of all that is Christ-like in the human
soul.
The ministers of Leeds are also aware.
that the existence of slavery in America, must
necessarily havo an injurious effect upon the
interests of other nations of the earth. Thev
have been given to understand, that the rights
cf Dritons themselves are already sacrificed,
in part, to the interests of that unholy and
unnatural institution. They have also dit
covered that those who hold men in slavery,
must necessarily seek to keep instruction
from the slaves. They are aware that the
American slave-holders deny their slaves the
liberty to learn to read and write that in the
slave States of America it is made death by
law, to attempt a second time to teacli the
slaves to learn the letters of the alphabet, or
to spell the name of God their Father in
heaven. The ministers of Leeds have also
been given to understand, that where slave
ry prevails, it necessarily generates a spirit
of bondage or servility in the minds of the
wholo community, and exerts its baneful in
fluence both on church and state, corrupting
and enslaving the minds of all. They are
aware that in the Slave Stales of America the

nolitical representatives of the Slate are bound
to tho defence and advocacy of slavery at all
hazard, and that the ministers of the various
religious denominations are tiod and bound
in like manner, to connive at the abomina
ti.ans 4 that system, and lo refrain from re
buking its guilty upholders. "" They are
that slavery has corrupted the churches
of America that members, and leaders, and
deacons, and elders, and preachers, nnd bish
ops, end churches, are involved in the guilt
of slave-folding that members and minis
ters of churches are to be found brecdingand

or the plundered wages oi tno siayes, our uy
iho price received at public auction for the
personB of the slaves. I say that with all
these things the ministers of the town
I.ecLS are, to somo extent at leasi, acquain
ted. They have read the reports of nnli-
slavory speeches in tho newspapers. Some
of them have read the narrativo of Frederick
Douglass ; and those who have not heard In
sneak, have heard accounts of his speeches
from those who have attended his lectures,
and have read reports of his speeches in the
newspapers published in their own town.
They are acquainted therefore with the groat
facts connected with American slavery.
They are aware lhat in the United States
America there are three millions of their fellow-creatures
held in the most abject and
nmnl hnmlnire. Thev are aware that
number of slaves is annually increasing that
the extent of territory occupied by slavery
annually enlarging that Texas has been
wrestpd from Mexico to be convertod from
land of freedom into a land of slavery
il,o United States are wacing war with
Mexico at this moment, tor the purpose
wresting from lhat power still greater tracts
of territory, and of converting California
New Mexico into slave plantations. They
are aware too that America obstructs llie
of England and othor European powers,
in their efforts to put down the slave-trade,
and to secure freedom and peace to the wide
spread population of Africa.
1 say me mimsiern ui
all these things ; and they are wishful
at least we are required to believe them wish
ful, that Ihose great evils should bo brought
to an end. It was not then because
were ignorant of the evil of slavery ; it
not because they were ignoran eexn
to which slavery prevail. -

arowth of this frightful evil ; .1 was not
they are wishful lo perpetuate
streng he Ibis most awful of all vices,
mostBterrible of all calamities, that the mm
Uten of Leeds chose to keep away from
meetings of the Anti-Slavery League.
What then was the reason
We answer, secondly, ihe ministers
not absent themselves from the mee ings
h. Anti-slavery League because they
the agenls of the League to be drun
ken. profligate, licentious men. or mer ,
are seeking their own interests by the
ofSnti-slaver, principle, t nor w..
because they considered the agents o t
Anti-slavciy League to be men of weak
tellects or feeble powers; persons ignorant of
the subject on which they presume to speak,
or unable to present the subject in its true
colors before the meetings which they ad
dress. On the contrary, they regard the a-
gents of the league as men of virtue and res
pectability; as persons of intelligence and
great abilities. I'hry know that they under
stand the subject on which they speak, and
that they are able to make that subject un
derstood by others. They know, that both
as speakers and as writers, they are persons
of superior powers ; men that can both exhi
bit truth to the understanding, and make it
tell by the heart, llipy know, that the pre
sident of the league, George Thopmson, is a
man oi unequalled powers, as well as a man
of high character. They know that the se
cretary too, if they are acquainted with him,
is a man of virtue and integrity, nnd of no
ordinary abilities as a speaker. They know
that the agent of the league, Frederick Doug
lass, is a man both of extraordinary talents,
and of a sterling, irreproachable character
that his spirit, hi3 language, his powers, all
combine to render him an object of intense
interest and of liMi admiration. The min
isters of Leeds are also aware, that Frederick
Douglass comes to them accredited by the
favorable testimonies of some of the most
respectable, intelligent, and pure-minded in
dividuals, both in America, in Ireland, and
in Great Britain. It was not therefore for
want of satisfactory information with respect
to the general character and the superior la I
ents of the agents of the Anti-slavery League
it was not for want of a knowledge that
the agents of the league were respectable, in
telligent individuals, disinterested, philan
thropic characters, that the ministers of Leeds
absented themselves from the meeting on
Thursday evening. What then was the rea
son 1
We answer ; the ministers of Leeds were
afraid lest the advocacy of the rights of the
slave, by the agents of the league, should in
jure the interests of religion t should endan
ger the stability of their religious denomina
tions, and exert an unlavorable influence upon
the credit and position of the ministers them
selves. The ministers of Leeds have learn
ed from various sources, that the anti-slavery
lecturers charge a great deal of the guilt of
slavery, upon the churches and ministers ol
America. They have learned that they con-
of

They have been informed that ono of the ad
vocales of the cause of the slave, has pub
1'ished a work entitled ' The American Chur
ches the Bulwarks of American Slavery
They have learned wilh dismay, that Wright
and Douglass, and Garrison, are prepared
risk the existence ol any lurm ol religion mat
justiiies slavery, ot any church that upholds
slavery, and of any ministry that connives
slavery. They have learned with dismay,
that Wright, and Douglass, and Garrison, are
bent upon the overthrow of slavery at all
hazards that they are prepared to risk the
07erthrow of every church, of every religious
system, of every religious sect, that stands in
the way ol the lull and speedy abolition ot
slavery. One of these men, II. C. Wright,
they havo learned, has declared himself rea
dy to put bis heel upon any government that
gives its B.inction to slavery ; to pul his heel
upon any religion that sanctifies slavery ;
put his heel upon every institution that is
war with the freedom and rights of any por
tion of the human family. They have found
that in speakinrr nirainst slavery, those lec
turers expose the guilt of the American chur
ches, and of the American ministers that be
fore mixed nnd crowded audiences they un
cover tho nakedness of their slave-holding
religious brelhrrn, and their beloved slave

known to the people of England the awful
fact, that the churches and ministers of Ame
rica generally are pro-slavery, and that many
of them are actually engaged in tho traffic
slaves that Methodist ministers, ISaptist
ministers, Independent ministers, Presbyte
rian ministers, and Episcopal ministers, are
all implicated in the guilt of slave-holding,
and in all the cruellies and abominations
connected with the slave system. These
lecturers have attempted to make it plain,
that before slavery can be abolished in Ame
rica, those slave-holding churches must
thoroughly revolutionised, or utterly destroy

the
that the deputations from the Daptist and In
dependent denominations were also faithles
to ihe interests nf the slave, and to the claims
of humanity, when they visited that land of
oppression. 1 he ministers of Leeds are nf
f prepared to controvert the statements of ths
eclurors ; they believe their statements r
correct; but they consider such revelations
lo be impudent, unsnfe, injurious to the Inter
ests of religion. They are concerned for ths
cause of tiod, or for Ihe interest of their re
epective denominations. They are afraid
lhat if these facts become generally known,
their religious denominations will sink In
public estimation, and lhat they themselves
will be shorn of much of their respectability
and influence. They also perceive that ths
Anti-Slavery lecturers are wishful to lay the)
burden and the task of rebuking the Amen
can churches upon them, and upon their cAur
7ie. They perceive lhat the anti-slavery
lecturers consider it to be the duty of the
churches and ministers of Great Britain, to
disclaim all Christian fellowship with thn
American churches, until they have purged
themselves from the guilt nnd abominations
of slavery. They perceive lhat if the princi-
files of the anti-slavery lecturers are general
y received, l hoy , the ministers will be called
upon at once to require, that the American
churches shall cilhor separate themselves
from slavery, or that they shall be called up
on to separate themselves from the American
churches. For a Btcp like this the ministers
of Leeds are not prepared. Many of the
ministers of this country are on friendly terms
with the slave-holding and slavery-advocating
ministers of America. Many of our
EnnliBh Doctors of Divinity have received
their honours from American theological in
stitutions. In some cases the churches of
this country have received liberal pecuniary
support from the churches of America; and
even lately, the Free (1) Church of Scotland
received no less than three thousand pounds
from the slave-holding churches of America
themselves, towards the erection of churches
and the support of their ministers. 1 o sepa
rate, therefore, at once from the American
slave-holding churches, would require a sac
rifice both ot enfres and of feeling on the
pari of Ihe ministers and churches ot this
country; and for such sacrifices, the minis
ters of this country sre not prepared.
llecnuse, it is douhtrul whether the Amer
ican Anii-slavery cause will become popular
in this country. It is doubtful whether the
wealth and respectability, the greatness and
the nobilily of this country, will take part in
the abolition movement. It is doubtful
whether the ministers of this country will bo
nble to increase lliofr usefulness, to add to
their popularity and influence amongst the
perple, by taking part with the friends of the
slave. The aboliiionists are stein, uncom
promising men. They appear to prefer the
principles they advocate, and the interests of
the cause in which they are engaged, to sve-'
ry oilier consideration. They do nol attempt
to conciliate Ihe prejudices of men. They pay
no regard to the feelings of those who stand
in their way. They epeak right out. They
utter their convictions, and their strong, ir
dignant feelings, in language the most un
guarded. Their rebukes of wrong and cruel
ty are terribly severe. They neglect the usu
al rules of prudence, and though men of migh
ty, of extraordinary abilities, they are lack
ing in tact and policy. And these qualities
expose them lo much reproach and opposi
tion. The world is too bad to be reformed
al once. It is too corrupt to bear the trulli
without a veil. It cannot bear the uncom
promising virtue of thoso unsparing reform
ers, it requires to be uean wun gciaiy, ji
requires to have tho truth presented lo it by
degrees. It requires to be brought over to tht
cause of freedom imperceptibly. These, the
principles ol policy, ol expediency, are Ihe
principles on which the ministers of this
country think It needlul to proceed. IJut
these principles are cast aside as worthless,
as un-chrislian, as wicked, by the anil-slave
ry lecturers. They go straight on. I hey
care for nothing but the true, the right, the
good. So far from being alraid to irritate the
evil-doers, they even seem to rejoice in Ihe
prospect of irritating and rousing them. So
far from being atraid ot snocKing me prejudi
ces of slave-holders, and of slavery-uphold
ing ministers and churches, they appear to
think they cannot shock such guilty ones loo
much, or shock them too soon. With the
spirit of such men, the orthodox ministers of
Leeds, and the orthodox ministers of this
counlry generally cannot sympathize. To
the principles and proceedings of such men,
lliey are unablo to give their sanction. They
consider that the interests of the church mint
be first secured, and the interests of humani
ty next, that the cliara.-lcrs of the ministers
of religion must bo hold sacred, whether sla
very he abolished or not, lhat the unity of
the church must be promoted if possible,
whether the slave can be emancipated or nol.
And it is on this account in the first place,
that the ministers of Leeds absented them
selves from the anti-slavery meetings, end
refused to take pnrt in the anti-slavery move
ment of the League,
Again ; the ministers of Leeds had anoth
er reason for absenting themselves from those
mcetinire. The advocates of abolitionism
have given no proof of the orthodoxy of their
opinions. Neither Garrison, nor Douglass,
nor Wright have given any satisfactory proof
to the Christians and ministers of this coon-
try, that they hold the great doctrines or the
gospel as held by the various orthodos de
nominations, and as embodied in the ortho
dox creeds of this land. They have given
no proof that they believe in the doctrine of
Ihe natural, hereditary and total depravity of
the human heart in consequence of the one
transgression of Adam. They have given no
satisfactory proof that they hold the doctrine

ing, that should real non-intervention obtain in 1
regard to these territories, it would he a vory (
great and very astonishing change from our pre*- 1
ent policy. 'Hie inhabitants of a territory hare
no voto in Congress. Nevertheless, real nou-iutervention
would vest them with the exclusive disposal
of important affairs, which are, now, at tho
exclusive disposal of Congress. It would compensate
them for their present political disabilities
with an amount of political power greatly
exceeding that enjoyed by an equal handful of
the people of a State.
To prevent misapprehension of my viows, I
add. that 1 am not opposed to making inhabitants
of the territory officers of the territory. As far
as practicable, I would have none others for its
officers. Hat, whilst the territory is the nation's,
all its officers should ba acknowledged to he officers
and servanM of the nation.
I proceed to say, that I am op{K>sed to this bill,
in the fourth place, because it looks to the existence
of slavery iu these territories, and provides
safeguards for it. la other words, Congress does,
by the terms of the hill, open the door for slavery
to enter those territories. Tho right of Congress
to <lo so I deny. I deny it, however, not becauae i
the compromise of 1820 denies it. Believing i
that compromise to be invalid, 1 cannot honeetiy i
laim anything under it. 1 disclaim ail rights i
under it, for tlio simple rowon. that a com pro- c
misc conceived in sin And brought forth in ini- I
rjuity, can impart no rights ? for the simple rea- i
ton, that a compromise, which annihiiatos rights, I
ranuot create rights. I admit, that the coinpro- a
mise of 1820 concede* the indestructibletiess of
manhood north of the line of 38? 30', excepting I
in Missouri. But, on the other hand, it atonos t
for this concession to truth and justice by impli- t
odly leaviug men south of that line, and in ?
Missouri, to be classed with brutes and things. 1 v
i.iinit, too, that they, wlio are enjoying the share c
r?f slavery uuder this compromise, and who, now, s
Lhat freedom was about to enter into the enjoy- ?
ment of her share under it?I admit, 1 say, that c
they are estopped from joining ine in pronouncing t
the Missouri compromise invalid. They must e
first surrender their share under the oompro- f
mise ? they must first make restitution to Free- t
lom ? ere they can, with clears hands and un- c
blushing faces, ask her to forego the enjoyment S
!>f her share. "" But this condition is imprartica- t
Ide!"" will some of my hearers say. Oh no! v
nothing is impracticable, that is right. Exclude s
davery from Missouri and Arkansas for thirty- v
Four years; and then freedom and slavery will I
be on an equal footing, aiul they can make a now
bargain. I Laughter.] e
Nor do 1 deny the right of Congress to open (
the door for slavery into these territories, because J
the compromise of 1850 virtually denies it. I i
say that compromise virtually deniee it, because r
it distinctly and approvingly recognises the com- r
promise of 1820. The compromise of 1850 is as r
rotten as the compromise of 1820; and as inca- i
pahle of imparting right*. And here let mo say, 1
that 1 rejoice to see tho pro-slavery party pour- s
ing express contempt on the compromise of 1820, 1
and virtual contempt on tho compromise of 1850. t
And why should uot all tnon pmrr contempt upon s
these compromises, and upon all other compro- r
miscs, which aim ""to split the difference"" be- a
tween Cod and the dovil ? [Great laughter.]
By tho way, we have striking proof, in the instance
of this bill, that, in the case of such compromises.
God's share and art are, in the end, very c
like to be claimed for the devil. [Renewed s
langhter.] I

deny tho right of Congress to open the door for i
slavery into these territories. I will now say on J
what ground it is. I deny it on the ground, that t
the Constitution, the only law of the territorieg, t
is not in favor. of slavery, and that slavery can- c
not be set up under it. ff there can be lawful c
slavery in the States, nevertheless there cannot f
be in tho territories. f
In the fifth and last place. I am opposed to tho ?
hill, becanso it allows, that there may be slavery t
in the States, which shall he formed from these s
territories. 1
Hitherto, when the slavery question has been 5
brought up in Congress, it hss been alleged, (I s
sav not how truly or nntruly,) that tho anti-sla- I
very party has brought it up. and for the purpose J
of checking slavery. But, now, it is, confessedly 1
on all hands, brought up by the pro-slavorv par- s
ty, and ft>r the purpose of extending slavery. Iu t
this instance, the pro-slavery party is. manifestly,
the instrument, which truth has wielded to sub- '
serve her purpose of re-awakening the public '
mind to the demands and enormities of slavery. '
Most sincerely do 1 rejoice, that the pro-slavery
party is responsible for the present agitation. t
A M smoke. I do not admit, that it is.
Mr. SMITH. Strange! Here is a movement
for the immense extension of slavery. Of course,
t is not the work of the anti-slavery party. And |
f the honorable member, who has just interrnptsd
uio. is authorized to speak for the pro-alalerv
party, it is not tho work of that party either. 1
1 took it for granted, that the pro-slavery party *
lid it. Bnt. it seems it did not. It puts on the
nuocent air of a Macbeth, and looks mo in tho *
ace, and exclaims: 1! Thou canst not say 1 did
t!"" [Laughter.] Well, if neither the anti- J
davery party, nor the pro-slavery party, did it,
ivho was it, then, that did it? It follows, ueces- J
iarily, that it must he the work of the Lord, or j.
he devil. [Laughter.] . But, it cannot bo the .
vork of the Lord?for the good book tellfi us:
' Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liber- 0
y"" ? liberty, not slavery. So, this Nebraska ^
nisiness must be the work c.f the devil. [Great j
anghler.J But logical as is jbis conclusion, 1 (
on, nevertheless, too polite to'press it. I prefer
o repudiate the alternative, that puts the respon- n
libility orf the Lord or the devil; and to return
o iny original assertion, that tho pro-slavery ^
mrty, and not the anti-slavery party, is respon- ,
:iblc for the present agitation. l)o not underitand,
that I would not have the anti-slavery ?
mrty agitate. I would have it agitate, and agi- ^
ate, and agitate forever. 1 believe, that the agiation
of the elements of the moral world is as ""
cMcntial to moral health, as is the agitation of
he elements of the physical world to physical 0
lenllh. I believe in the beantiful motto: ""The n
igitation of thought is the beginning of truth."" ?
was very happy to hear the honorable gentle- ^
nan of Pennsylvania,* [Mr. Wrioht,] express his
ailh and pleasure in agitation. Not less happy ^
e as I to hear the honorable gentleman of North
'arolina, [Mr. Cli.sgmax,] approve of the discnslion
of Slavery. Surh good abolition doctrine
rroin such surprising sources was very grateful to f
:ne. Perhaps, those gentlemen will continue to r
more forward in that blessed upward way, on
which they have happily entered; and, perhaps, ,
ere the session shall close, they will hare reached ,
I hat table-land of abolition, on which it is my
privilege to stand. Let me assure them, for the ?
purpose of cheering them onward, that, when
they shall arrive there, they shall not lack lay j
warm greetings and the cordial grasp of my hand,
[flrcat laughter.] Sir, you must permit me to (
indulge some hope of the conversion of these
gentlemen. Indeed, when I heard the honorable .
gentleman of North Carolina speak of himself as
"" an independent""?as a party of one?as in that 8
lone condition, in which he had so recently heard
me say, that 1 find myself?was 1 not at liberty 8
to imagine, that he was throwing ont a sly, delicate
hint to my ear. that he would like to ""join 1
teams with me, and so make np a party of two ? r
[Repeated roars of laughter.] I do not forget. c
ihat, at the close of his speech, he said some very r
hard things against us naughty abolitionists. ?
But how eould I be sure, that he did not say
tlieso hard things for no other purpose than to 8
blind all around him, save, of course, my own
apprehensive, because kindred and sympathiriug, *
spirit, to that fraternal union with me, which I ?
have supposed his heart was then meditating? T
I said, a little while ago. that 1 rejoiee, that the
pro-slavery party is responsible for the present 8
ngitation. 1 add, that 1 am half reconciled to ^
this attempt to extend the dominion of slavory,
because it affords ns so inviting an opportunity ""
to inquire into the title of slavery. If my neigh- ?
bor tries to rob me of my farm, he, at least, ?
sffords me an occasion for inquiring into the
tenure, by which he holds his own farm. Free- ?
lorn having been driven by slavery, until she *
has surrendered to her pursuer nine new States; ^
ind until slavery claims, as we sec in the present ^
Rill, equal right with herself to overspread all j
the unorganized territory of the nation; it is, in
my judgment, high time for her to stop, and ^
to turn about, and to look slavery in the face, ^
and to push bark the war?ay, and to drive the
aggressor to the wall, provided she shall find, ~
that slavery, in all its progress, and history, is
nothing but an aggression upon liberty and law,
and npon human and divine rights; and that, in *
truth, it has no title to any existence whatever, on ^
an}- terms whatever, anywhere whatever. This is 0,

nil know enough of freedom and slavery to yi

she is determined to lack them no longer.
_>ne of these two things is its cohceded right to

>he other is its conceded right to carry slaves
hrough the free States. Let alavery succeed in
heee two resjieeta:?let the bill, we are now

svun to drive cottlce of slaves through them, whipu-band;
thus breaking dowu the public sentinvut
of those States against slavery; and detauching
and wasting it by familiarizing it with
he demands and exhibitions of slavery; ? and
hen, I admit, the way will he clear for slavery
o make a quick aud easy conquest of liberty.
1, again, acknowledge my partial recoucileneut
to this attempt of slavery to get more? J 1
o this bold push for all, that is leA, so far as
luorganizod territory ia concerned. We have
tow the best of opportunities for trying the title
>f alavery, not only to more?but, alio, to what
t already had. And, now, if alavery shall come
itf as badly as ths dog, who, in opening his
uouth to seize another piece ofineal, lost, in the
leoeitftil and shadow-casting stream, tho piece
te already hail, it will have no one to bl|uuo for
is folly, but its own voracious self. It should
tava boon content with the big share?the lion's
hare?which it already had.
Hut to return from this digression. I said, that
am opposed to tho bill, because it allows, that
here may be slavery iu ths .States, which shall
te formed from these territories. Why, howivor,
should I he, therofore, opposed to it? I
rill, without delay, come to the reason for my
tppositiou. My timo. being so precious, because
o limited, I will waste none of it in apologise,
lireumlocutious, or skirmishes. But 1 will, at
ince, ""take the boll by the horns,"" and declare,
hat I deny the right of Congress to look to the
ixistonce of slavery in Ihe States, that shall be
ormed within these territories, because 1 deny,
hat there can be Constitutional slavery in any
>f the States of the American Union?friture
Itates. or present States?new or old. I hold,
hat the Constitution, not only authorizes no slaery,
hut ponnit* no slavery ; not only creates no
lavery in any part of the land, hut abolishes sla ery
in evory part of the land. In other words,
hold, that there is no law for American slavery.
I had not intended a moment's further delay in
intering upon my argument to prove, that the
uiiKumuun cans ior ?ne suppression or an
Vmerioan slavery. Rut I most, before entering
ipon it, beseech the Committee to hold no other
nemher of Congress responsible for it. Let the
eproach of this argument?of this foolish argunont,
if you ploaae?nay, of this insane argument,
f you prefer that epithet?fall on myself only,
tlame no other memhor of Congress for it. I
tand alone. I am the first, and, perhaps, I shall
>e the last, to declare within these walls, that
hero is no law for slavery. I say, that I stand
done. And, yet, I am not alone. Truth is with

Mansfield's derision in the Somerset case
stablishod the fact, that there was no law for
lavery in. England in 1772:?and if none in
England, then none in America. For, by the
erms of their charters, the Colonies could hare '
10 laws repugnant to the laws of England.
\las! that this decision was not followed up by
he assertion of the right of every American slavo
o liberty! Had it been, then would our land, this
lay, he bright and blessed with liberty, instead
>f dark and cursed with slavery. Alas, that the
mrlior decision than Mansfield's was not thus
ollowed up! This earlier decisiou was of the
luperior Court of Massachusetts, and was of
he same character with Mansfield's.? [Jainr*
rs. Laohmert, Waxhhurn, 202.] We are not at
iherty to regard this decision of the Court of
ilassachusetts as wrong, because Massachusetts
larery was not abolished in consequence of it.
t is no more wrong, because of that fact, than is
Jansfield'a, because of the like fact. Slavery in
England survived Mansfield's docision. Even
even years after it, and advertisement, such as
his, oould be found in English newspapers :
' To he sold by auction at George Dunbar's
office, on Thursday next, the 20th instant, at 1
o'clock, a black boy. about fourteen years of
age, At. Liverpool, Oct. 15, 17T9.''
There was no law for Amorican slavery, after
he Declaration of Independence was adopted,
lad there bean any before, this paper swept it all
way. Chief Justice Shaw suggests, that it was
his paper, which abolished slavery in Massahusette.?[Cotmnonrrfialth
vs. TUnman Arcs.] No
ess fatal was it, however, to the legality of
lavery in other parts of the nation. The Deelaation
of Independence is the highest human
uithority iu American polities. It is customary
o trace back the origin of our national existence
nd our American Union to the Federal Constiution,
or to the Articles of Confederation. Rut
iur national existence and our American Union
lad their birth in the Declaration of Indepcndnce.
The putting forth of this paper was the s
irst sovereign act of the American people?their s
irst national and authoritative utterance. The
terlaration of Independence was the declaration
if the fact of the American Union: and to that
iaper pre-eminently are we to look for the causes
nd character and objects of the American Union,
t was for a present, and not for a prospective,
""nion?for a Union already decided on, and not '
, contingent Union?that our Fathers went
hrough a seven years war. It is noteworthy,
hat the object of the Constitution, as set forth
y itself, is not to originate a Union, but ""to
orm a more perfect Union''?that is, to improve
n an already eiisting Union. The Articles of
Confederation and the Federal Constitution were
iut expedients for promoting the perpetuity, and
nultiplying and securing the happy fruits, of this
fuion. Not only is it not true, that the Articles
f Confederation and the Federal Constitution
.re paramount to the Declaration of Independnce,
but it is true, that the Congress of the Conederation
and the Convention, which framed the
""onstitution, derived nil their legitimacy and e
uthoritv from the Declaration of Independence.
'oh might as well talk of supplanting the Bible p
rith the farthing Tract written to expound it, a* a
alk of supplanting the Declaration of Independ- a
nee with an/ subsequent paper. Truly, did one t
if the eminent statesmen [Gen. Root] of in/ State 1
aj: "" That the Declaration of Independence ia the f
fundamental law of the land in all those States, a
which claimed or admitted, that that instrument r
was framed by their agents;"" and truly did an- n

<ID PROPRIETOR; JOH
WASHINGTON, THU
The enunciation of tliia great centre truth of
?he Declaration of Independence, would hare justified
every American slave, at the time of that
Hiunciation, in claiming hia liberty. Suppose
that, after the adoption of the Declaration of Inlepcndence,
an American patriot had been seized
>y a British force, and put on trial for rebellion
igainst the King, would not that paper hare justified
hiin in calling on hia countrymen to doliTer
iim? Certainly; for that i>aper asserts the right
to break away from hia allegiance to the King,
uul pledges the "" lire#, fortunes, and sacred hon>ry'
of his countrymen to maintain that right.
Jut suppose, that, after the adoption of the Decaratiou
of Independence, an American slave had
issortod his right to liberty, might ho not, as well
u the patriot referred to, hare called on his coun- j
ryrnen to acknowleilge and defend his right?
Certainly; and a thousand fold more emphatically.
For the right of the patriot to dissolve his
illegianco to the Crown is but a deduction from
bo great centre truth of the papor. that all men
ire created equal, aud hare inelieuable rights.
Jut the title of the slave to hie liberty?that is, to
>ue of these inalienable rights ? is this greet
ieutro truth itself. Tho title of the slave to his
iberty is the great fountain-head right. But the
alia of the patriot to be reemed from bit peril ia
>nly a derivation from that fountain-bond right.
Vfe add, a* a reaaon, why thia great ccutre
ruth of human equality and inalienable right to
iberty ia entitled to supremacy in all the aha>iug
and interpretation of American politica, that,
mi for it, and for tho place it eccupiee in tbo
JocUuation of Independence, there would have
>eeu no American Constitution, and no Americau
lation, and no American liberty. But for the
:ommanding principle and mighty inspiration of
liia great centro truth, the colonist* could not
tare been aroused to their glorious achievement,
t was m hoe siyiio?it waa by tlii* sign ? that
>ur fathers conquered, Again : but for this cornnandiug
principle, aud this mighty inspiration,
ho aid?the indispensable aid?that came to ns
rom foreign shores, would uot have come. Said
.>a v atrtth to Thomas Olarksox : "" I would never
have drawn my sword in the cause of America,
if I could have conceived, that thereby I was
founding a land of slavery.'' And there was
aorcicsko, at whose fall <l Freedom phrieked,""
ind who provided by tho will, written by himself,
hat his property in America should he usod by
lis anti-slavery friend, Thomas Jrwhbhos, in liberating
and educating Africhir slaves. Surely, bo
vould not. with his eyes open, havo fought to
roate a power, that should be wielded in behalf
if African slavery! Oh, how cruel ami mean a
rand on those, who fought for American liberty,
o use that liberty for establishing and extending
American slavery!
But wo pass on from the Declaration of Indeicndenee
to the Federal Constitution, and sup>ose,
for the sake of the argument, that slavery
urvived the Declaration of Independence. Now,
>ur first question is not what w the character of
he Constitution, in respect to slavery.4>ut what,
rom the circumstances of the case, might wo realonably
expect to lind its character, in this reipect.
Its reasonably expected character may bo
bought by many to shed light upon ih? actual
:haractcr. Looking at tho circumstances of tho
:*sc, are we to expect to find the Constitution
iro-slavery or anti-plaverv ? ? made to uphold
ilavery, or to leave it an unprotected outlaw ?
It is argued, that the Constitution must he on
ihe side of slavery. for the reason, that it did not
ipeeific&lly demand the instant death of slavery,
[""here is, however, no foreo iu this argument, if we
otlect,that American slavery was, at that time, a
lying slavery ; and that, therefore, even those of
>ur statesmen, who were most opposed to it, were
generally willing to leave it to die a natural death,
ather than to force it out of existence. Were a
nan condemned to he hang?nevertheless, if,
vhen the day for hanging him had arivod, he
vere on liis death-bed, you would not hang him,
>ut you would leave him to die on his bed?to
lie a natural, instead o? a violent, death. That
mr fathers did not anticipate the long continumce
of slavery, is manifest from their purpose
lisclosed in the Preamble of tho Constitution and
lecw here, to set up a government, which should
naintain justice and liberty. They knew, that
10 government could prove itself capable of this,
f under the influence, especially the overshadiwing
influence, of slavery.
It is further argued, that the Constitution must
>e on the side of slavery, beeanse were it not on
hat side, the slaveholders would not have con;ontod
to its adoption. But they, who argue thus,
confound the slaveholders of that day with the
laveholdors of this. They forget, that the slavetolders
of that day breathed the spirit of the
)eclaratiun of Independence, and were captivated
>y the doctrine of the human brotherhood.^ They
'orget, that the slaveholders of that day were im>atient
to emancipate their slaves, and that in
rirginfa, whore the number of slaves was so much
ess than now. they were emancipated, at that
>eriod, at the rate of a thousand a year. They
orget, that there were Abolition Societiee in
lave States, both before and after the year
800. They forget, that Washington and Jefferson
vere practical emancipationists. They forget,
hat, whilst the slaveholders of this generation are
ntent on perpetuating and extending slavery, the
Iaveholders of that generation, studied how to
ibolish it. and rejoiced in tho prospect of its speedy
ibolition. They, forget, that, whilst the slaveinlHars
nf this dav are eaffer to oversnrearl our
vhole national territory with slavery, all etho
laveholders of that day joined with all other
Americans in denying it new territory, and cxeluling
it from ever? foot of the national territory.
I'hey forget, that all the Mtatcs, at that time, with
he exception of South Carolina and Georgia, advocated
the anti-slavery policy; and that even
hese two States could hardly bo said to hare
>pposed it. And what, more than everything
dse, they should not forget, is that, over the whole
ength and breadth of the land, slavery was, at that
lay, a confessed sin?a sin it is. true, that all involved
in it had not the integrity to put away imnediately?but
a sin, nevertheless, which all of
hem purposed to put away, in no very distant
uture. How striking the caatrast, in this respect,
>etween the circumstances of the slaveholder of
hat time and the slaveholder of this! Now, the
lible, both at the North and at the South, is
laimed to be for Slavery ; and now the church
ind chnreh-ministrv, at the South, do nearly all
;o for slavery; and at the North, do nearly all
tpologir.e for it. Now, slavery is right, and the
ibolition of it wrong. Now, the slaveholder is
he saint, and the abolitionist the sinner. To ilustrate,
in still another way, the absurdity of inerring
what slaveholders desired and did, sixty or
eventy years ago, from what they desire and do
iow :?the pecuniary motive of the slaveholder to
iphold slavery is now very strong. Thon, it was
ery weak. American cane-sugar, now wet with
he tears and sweat and blood of tens of thousands
if slaves, was then scarcely known. American
otton, which now fills the markets of the world,
ras then in none of the markets of the world,
'hen it was not among the interests of our eounry.
Now, it is its dominant interest. It sways
hnrch and state and commerce, and compels all
>f them to go for slavery. Theu the price of the
lave, that now sells for a thousand or fifteen
mnHmH rirtllnrfi hnt ivcrs HnnrirA/4 /4/tll* t-m
I need say bo more.to show how liable we are
o misinterpret the desires and designs of our
athers.'in regard to the Constitution, if we look
hrough the medium of the pro-slavery spirit
nd interests of our own day, instead of the meium
of the anti-slavery spirit and interests of
heir day. To judge what character they would
* like to give to the Constitution, in respect to
lavery, we must take our stand-point amidst the
nti-siavery scenes and influences of that period,
nd not amidst the pro-slavery scenes and iiiucnces,
which illustrate and reign orer the
resent.
I readily admit, that the slaveholders of the
resent day would not consent to the making of
ny other than a pro-slavery Constitution. I
en admit, that, had the making of the Oonstiution
been delayed no more than a dozen years,
; would, (eonld it then have been made at all,)
ave been pro-slavery. I make this admission,
ecause I remember, that, during those dozen
ears, Whitney's cotton gin. (but for which inTenon
American slavery would, long ago, hare disppeared,)
came into operation, and fastened slaery
upon our country.
In tho light of what I have said, how improliale
it is, that the slaveholders were intent on havkg'the
Constitution made to uphold slavery,
nt, in the light of what I shall now say, how
nprobahle it is. that such a Constitution was
iade. Mr. Madison was among the most influenal
members of the Convention, that framed the
onstitntion ; and when he declared, in the Con- 1
ntion, that he ""thought it wrong to admit in the
Constitution the idea, that there could be prop- 1
srty in man,"" not one person objected to the dec- 1
ration'. Indeed, the frame is of the Constitution, I

they obviously determined, that, if after ages or
should make the humiliating discovery, that there po
had been slavery in this land, there, nevertheless, pr<
should ho nothing in the ]>&ges of the Constitution rof
to help them to such discovery. For instance, the vi
word "" service"" occurs ropeatedly in tho Constitu- off
tion. Rut only four days before the Convention of
closed its labors, tho word "" servitude H was struck su>
out of tlio Constitution, and tho word ""service""' iui
unanimously adopted in its place, for the avowed els
reason, that the former expresses the condition tin
of slaves, and the latter the obligations of free rej
persons. 1 add tho incidental remark, that if the po
Constitution is responsible for slavery, it is so, bl?
be cause of the knavery, or ignorance, of its fra- I be
mors. If ou tho one hand, notwithstanding their ad
avowed reaaon for the substitution of ""ecrvioe"" po
for "" servitude,'* tlioy still intended to have the in
Constitution thus responsible, then they wero vii
knaves:?and if. on the other, they honestly in- is
tended to keep tho Constitution clear of this guilty th<
responsibility, and yet failed to do ao, then does in*
such failure betray their gross ignorance?tlioir lot
gross ignorance of th4 Hue meaning, and fit use, sla
of words. Happily, for thoee. who giro an anti- isl:
slavery construction to the Constitution, they are set
under no necessity and no temptation to inter- do
pret tho motives and condnct of its frainers in
the light of so odious an alternative. The pro- wl
slavery party alone are compelled so to interpret an
theui. Now, eveu were it true, that the frauiers er<
of the Constitution, and all of them, too, sought ?ti
to smuggle slarery into it?to get it into it, with- on
out its being seen to be got into it?nevertheless, a i
how could they accomplish tins object, which, by is 1

But we will remain no longer outsido of the

oan be nothing, outside of it, which can deter- sla
mine, or in any wise affect, its character on the th?
subjeet of slavery. Nothing in the history of cla
the framing, or adoption, or operation, of the St J
Constitution, can be legitimately cited to prove, it 1
that it is {Nto-slarery or anti-slavery. The point Co
is to be decided by the naked letter of the instru- doi
rarnt, and by that only. If the letter is cortainly vei
for slarerV then the Constitution is for slavery? oui

thofe is nO more reasonable mle of interpretation if
than that, which denies, that a law is to ho con- me
strued in ?avor of such injustice, when the law abi
does not i:i clear and express terms, embody and Co
ganction it. Tho Supreme Court of the United wli

Much stress is laid on the intentions of the C',J
framors of the Constitution. But we are to make Wl
little more account of their intentions than of the ani
intentions of the scrivener, who is employed to l^s
write the deed of the land. It is the intentions f,'n
of the adopters of the Constitution, that we are tio
to inquire after ; and these we are to gather from f>rc
tho words of the Constitution, and not from the fu'
words of its franiers?for it is the text of the 'nT
Constitution, and not the talk of the Convention, w''
""that the people adopted. It was the Constitution
itself, and not any of the interpretations of it,
nor any of-tho talks or writings about it, that the the
people adopted. ,n
8uppose, that the bill, now under disenssion, ?n.
should, unhappily, become a statute?would it if1
be necessary, in ordor to understand it, to know '
what the honorable gentleman of Kentucky,
[Mr. I'rrstox,] who preceded me. said of it. or ' 1
what I am saying of it? Certainly not. If I ,n
mean what I say. nevertheless, my words could 1
have no legitimate bearing on the interpretation ani
of tho stntnte. But my speech may be insincere.
1 may, as. doubtless, many a legislator has done, in,j
be practicing on Talleyrand's definition : ' Cangunge
is the art of concealing the thoughts : ?
and pray, what help, in that case, to the just **'
interpretation of tho statute, could my speech
afford?
I said, that the Constitution is what its adopt
ers understood it to he?not what tne distinguished
few among thun?hut what the masses? c ''
understood it to he: and what that was, the w
abolition petition, headed with the name of Bsv- J5*'

That it was not successful is another evidenee, jL1'
that the views of the people often differ from the 1

did exist ameng, at least, some of the statesmen rna
of that df>, that slavery was not to he killed by
i the immediate application of the powers of the TPr
Constitution, hut was to he allowed to linger
through that age. Whilst, I deny, that there is a
word in the Constitution to authorize the con- ^
tinuancc of slavery, I, nevertheless, admit that .'
there wait outside of the Constitution, the understanding
to which I have referred?an understanding
confined, however, to a few. and for j
whicli the masses were not responsible. A sad ^
mistake, as it turns out, was this suffering of '
slavery to drag out its death-struck and feeble ""
existence through that generation, in which the 1
Constitution was adopted !?for, it was in that r'a
very generation, that, in consequence of the in- to '
vention already spoken of, slavery became strong, an<
and began to demand prolonged life and vast
powers as a right?an absolute snd permanent to I
right. The slut, in La Fontaine's fable, on the or
eve of becoming a mother, implored, the brief to
loan of a kennel. But having once got posses- exf
sion of it, she found excuse for continuing the arc
possession, until her young dogs were grown up.

This fable illustrates, but too well, the successive 1
feebleness, and growth, and usurpation of slavery. "" pi
We begin with the Preamble of the Constitu- uni
tion. This, at least, is anti-slavery : and this lan
tells n* that the Constitution is anti-slavery? not
for it tells us, that one thing, for which the Con- the
stltution was made, was "" to secure the blessings the
of liberty""?not to inflict, or sustain, the curse of unl
slavery ^but ""to socure the blessings of liberty."" tioi
I admit^ that the Preamble is not the Constitn- pro
tion. ' admit, that it is but the porch of the tno
temple- Nevertheless, if, instead of the Pemon noi
or Ma'wj coiiea up in tnat porrn, we see ine or
Goddess of Liberty standing proudly there, then spe
we mey infer, that the temple itself, instead of the
being polluted with Slavery, is consecrated to ""tit
Liberty. And we are not mistaken in this in- foo
ference. As we walk through the temple, we Am
find, that it corresponds with the entrance. The thu
Constitution is in harmony with the Preamble.
The first reference, in the Constitution, to sla- ft'g
very, is in the apportionment clause. There is, ""iti
however, no reference to it here, if the language are
is interpreted, according to its legal sense, or if eve
the framers of the Constitution were intelligent Res
and honest. It must be remarked, that it was i""c<
from this clause, that they struck out the word wh;
"" servitude,"" for the avowed purpose of saving it the
from being a pro-slavery clause. But, in point Rut
of fact, if this clause does refer to slavery, it is,
nevertheless, a clause not to encourage, but to coa
discourage, slavery. The clause diminishes the
power of a State in the national councils in pro- to t
portion to the extent of its slavery. This clause itj 1
is, in truth, a bounty on emancipation. Had it tree
provided, that drnnkards should each count but hig'
three-fifths of a man, it, surely, weuld not be of t
called a clause to encourage drunkenness. Or,
had it provided, tb&t they, who can neither read sift'
nor write, should each eount but three-fifths of Sou
a man, it, surely, would not be called a clause rl*r
to encourage illiteratenese. In the one case, it mor
would be a bounty on sobriety, andkin the other, drcr
on education. all 1
The next clause of the Constitution, which we T?7
will examine, is that, which, confessedly, empow- the i
srs Congress to abolish the foreign slave-trade. *hal
I, of course, mean the clause, which empowers shot
Congress to regulate commerce with foreign na- l?te<
(ions. Yee, the slave States confessedly conceded
to Congress tbe power to abolish that trade j ing <

d CongreM did actually abolish it. But, it is t>
d, that the provision, respecting 44 migration t

wer for twenty years. Under no legal and s
>per souse of it, however, does this provision c
er to slaves. But, for the sake of the argument, 4
> will admit, that it does, and that it had the 1
set to suspend, for twenty years, the exercise 4
the power in question. What then? The t
ipenaiou could not destroy, nor, to any degree, t
pair, ths essential anti-slavery character of the r
mis under consideration. On the contrary, o
? suspension itself shows, that the clause was n
jarded, by the makers of the Constitution, as t
tentially anti-slavery?as one, that was capa- c
t of being wielded, and that, probably, would <j
wielded, to suppress the slave-trade. 1 would
d, that this briof suspension goes to justify the t
sition, that American slavery was looked upon, a
that day, as a rapidly expiring practice?as a ii
:e, that would dio out, in a few yoars. Thore I
much historical evidence, that the abolition of f
s slave-trade was looked to by many, if not, p
loed, by most, at that time, either ns equiva- v
it to, or as sure to result in, the abolition of I
ivcry. The power given to Congress to ahol- t]
t the slave-trade, Mr. Daww, in the Massachu- c
ts Convention, that a<lopted the Constitution, t
dared to be 14 the mortal wound"" of slavery. i
Manifestly, the clause of the Coue'ilution. c
icfa imparts power to abolish the slave-trade* 'J
d not that, which briefly suspends the eies- \
ise of this powor, gives character to the Con- t
tutiou. If my neighbor deeds mo his farm, l
ly reserving to himself the possession of it for t
nonth. (and a week in the life of an individual c
longer than twenty years in the life of a us- i
n,) it would, certainly, be very absurd to call i
i transaction for continuing him in the owner- c
P and possession of tho farm. Or, if the bar- t
in, which 1 make with my neighbor, is, that, s
or a week's delay, he shall come into my ser- I
? for life, it is certainly not this little delay,
it is to stamp the essential and important t
aracter of the bargain. ii
I have reforred to only a part of the clause, e
licit gives power to Congress to abolish tho h
ve-trade; to only that part, which respects (
s foreign slave-trade. I, now. add, that this c
,ll?0 cives ermal nnwer to abolish the inter- r
lie glare-trade. And if it doc?, how idle must i(
he to iay, that a Conititution, which empower* u
ngress to abolish, not only the foreign, hut tho -J
mestic glare-trade, is a Constitution for alary!
To abolish the domestic slave-trade is to C
t the very jugular of slavery. p
But it is said, that the power "" to regulate com- a
>rce among the several States "" ia not a power ]
abolish the slave-trade between them. But, t
it is not, then the power "" to regulate com- p
iree with foreign nations "" is not a power to t
oliah the African slave-trade. Nevertheless, t
ngress held, that it was; and, in that day,
len slavery was*not in tho ascendant, every- c
dy agreed with Congress.
It is further said, that the Constitution knows c
man beings only as persona; and that, hence, c
> inter-State traffic in slaves, being, in its eye, d
t migration or travel, Congress has 110 power 0
suppress it. Then, what right had Congress t
abolish the African slave-trade ? The subjects v
that traffic, no less than the subjects of the a
cr-Htate traffic, are persons. Another reply, c
lich we make to the position, that all human t
ings are persons in tho eye of tho Constitution, n
that it cannot lie in the mouth of those, who r
tj on the traffic in slaves, to ignore the true h
iraeter of that traffic, and to shelter its chat- n
-subjects under the name of persons. And F
other reply, which wo make to this position is, ii
it it is true; and that, hence, the traffic, in b
ves, every slave being a person, is uneonstitu- v
nal. If the Constitution grants power to Con- fi
>ss over commerce, it necessarily defines the v
ojects of the commerce. Such definition is s
olved in such grant. But slaves cannot come f
thin such definition?for pIktcs are persons, s
rl persons cannot be the subjects of commerce. 4
d still another reply, that we have to make to 4
>se, who would exempt the inter-State traffic 4
human beings from the control of Congress. '
the ground, that Congress can know no human 4
ing as a chattel, or n4 other than * person, is 4
it they are driven by logical consistency and 4
peal necessity to the conclusion, that the Con- 4
lotion has power to sweep away the whole of 4
sei ican slavery. The Constitution extends its 4
eld over every person in the United States; 4
d every person in the United States has rights 4
icified in tli? Constitution, that are entirely '
ompatible with hit subjection to slavery. 4
Ere leaving this topic, F would notice an objec- 4
n, which is frequently heard from the lips of 4
nest anti-slavery men. It is, that the Consti- 4
ion omits to command Congress, in terms, to 4
rdish the African slave-trade, even at the end 4
the twenty years. But why do they fail to see, 4
it. this very omission marks the anti-slavery 4
trader of the Constitution and of the day. 4
en it was written? Doomed slavery then
ided an express stipulation for its respite. Hut 1*
enjoin anti-slavery action upon those, who
jld be held back from it only by such express c
[?ulation, was, of course, deemed superfluous. 1<
? sentence of the court is, that the mother shall tl
t kiss her infant for twenty days. The court d
?d not enjoin, that she shall kiss it, after the !
only days are expired. Her love for her infant o
kes such injunction quite superfluous. So
s it unnecessary to enjoin upon the anti-sla- /<
y zeal of our fathers the abolition of the slavedc,
at the expiration of tho twenty years. t<
ircelv had the twenty years expired, before o
it zeal forbade, under tho heaviest penalties, u
i continuance of that accursed trade. An an- ii
nt nation regarded parricide as too unnatural tl
1 monstrous a crime to need tho interdiction s
law. And our fathers regarded the African t<
vc-trade as a crime so unnatural and inon- h
nus, as to make their injunctions on Congress o
abolish it altogether superfluous. o
A'e have, now. disposed of two of the three
uses of the Constitution, which are assumed 11
He pro-slavery, viz : the apportionment clause,
1 the migration and importation clause. The n
rd refers to fugitive servants, but certainly not
iigitive slaves. Whether we look at tho letter c'
history of this clause, it can have no reference w
slaves. No one pretends, that slaves are ''
iressly and clearly defined in it; and, hence, c
ording to the rule of the Supremo Court, 11
ich I have quoted, slaves arc not referred to n
it. Again, none deny, that the terms of the n
use make it applicable to apprentices, minor 'f
Idrrn, and others. All admit, that, in the ^
st natural use of language, it is capable of
ocent applications. 9l
1'he clause, under consideration, speaks of a
srson held to service or .labor in one State,
ier the laws thereof.'' Now, unless thpse
s are for slavery, the 44 service or labor"" can;
be slavery:?and if they nre for slavery, then
y cannot hold any person to slavery, unless ""
V are valid laws. Hut they are not valid laws, j
less they are in harmony with the ConstHu- .
a. If the Constitution is against slavery, then ''
i-slaverv laws are but nominal laws. It will be ""
re timely, At the rlose of my argument than
r, to say, whether the Constitution is against, ^
for, slavery. In the next place, the clause
aks of a person. Hut, as we shall more fully see, et
re are rights claimed for persons by the Con- ni
ution itael/, which must all be trodden under th
t. before person* can be reduced to slavery. T
other reason, why the fugitives referred to in c<
? clause are not slaves, is. that ' service or a?
or"" is ""due"" to their employer from these of
itivcs. But slaves, by every American dofi- b<
on of slaves, are as incapable of owing, as v<
horses, or even horse-hlocks. Bo too, by si
ry English definition of slaves. Says Justice m
t, in case of Forbes xs. Corhran: ""A slave is at
spable of compact."" And another reason, sc
r this clause cannot refer to slaves i* that sc
fugitives in it are held by the laws to labor, ot
slaves, no more than oxen, are held by the si'
s to labor. The laws no more interpose to ai
ipel labor in the one case than in the other, br
1 stili another reason, why this clause is not di
>e taken as referring to slaves, is the absurd- co
of supposing, that our fathers consented to ru
,t as slaves whatever persons, white or black, In
i or low, virtuous or vicious, any future laws w<
inv State might declare to be slaves. Shall nn
of the North be bound to acquiesce in the wt
ery of our children, who tnay emigrate to the is
th, provided the laws of the South shall de- air
e Northern emigrants to be slaves? Nay, cri
e, shall we be bound to replnnge those rhil- of
i into slavery, if they escape from it? Bnt m*
bis we shall be bound to do, if the pro-sla- Ku
' interpretation of the clause in question is thi
true interpretation. Ay, and in that case, we fee,

ant and unauthorized. The Supremo Court of m
ho United State* opened a wide door to this eud, at
u the case of Strader and others against (iorfuun, ot
ouie throe years ugo. In that case, the court hi
lainied, tliat a State "" has an undoubted right to
determine tho statu*, or domeetic and social con- si
ditlon, of the persons domiciled within its terri- lii
tor;r."" Hy tho way. this doctrine of the Supreme
'ourt, that there are no natural rights; and cr
hat all rights stand but in the concessions and w
incertainties of human legislation, is a legitimate M
ntgrowth of slavery. For slavervtis a war upon m
laluro, and is thu devourer of thu rights of na- in
ure ; and claims, that all rights, and all inter- A
sts, natural and conventional, shall acoommo- it
iate themselves to its demands. in
We uood spend no more time on tho letter of In
his clause. W? will, now. look at its history. It is w
. well-nigh universal impression, that this clause tli
? one of the compromises of the Constitution, sli
Silt there is not the slightest foundation iu truth
or this impression. In none of the numerous in
ilnns of a Constitution, submitted to its framurs. si
r.is the subjoct-matlor of this clans? moiitionnd. vi
ndeed, it was not mentioned at all, until twenty si
lavs before the close of the Convention. This
dause. wlarn its iuscrtion was first moved, con- st
aincd the Word ""slave."" But, with that word in tli
t, it met with such strenuous opposition, as to ei
ompel the immediate withdrawal of the motion, tit
I'lie next day, however, it was offered again, but
vith the word "" slave'' struck out. Iu this or
imeuded and harmless form, it was adopted inilUS.

idd, by tlie waj, tluit no ouo believes, that a cv
lause providing, in express terms, for tho sur- (v
nder of the whole Americaii soil to the chasing ""
town and enslaving of men. women, and children, fo
lould over have gained the vote of the Couven- th
ion; or that, if it had, tho Constitution, with la
uch a disgusting blot upon it, could evor have ai
>cen adopted. gi
Another reason for not claiming this clause to w
te pro-slavery is, that tho American people did, pi
ii all probability, regard the word ""service""' as
spreading the condition of freemen. So, as we o
lave seen, tho members of tho Constitutional
Convention, regarded it: and, inasmuch as they '
ame together from ull parts of the country, and 4
epreseutod all classes and sections of the Amer- 4
ran people, is it not a fair infereuco, that they 4
ised language in the sense approved by the
Imerican people?
Wc have, now, examined those parts of the 4 i
Constitution, which are relied on to give it a '
iro-slavery character; and wo find, that they ' I
,re not entitled to give it this character. Wo 4 |
iroceod to (fiance at some, and at only some, of
hose parts of tho Constitution, which clearly bt
rove its anti-slavery character; which are ut- 41
erly incompatible with slavery; and which, 4 l
herofore, demand its abolition. 4 1
1st. ""Congress kits power to provide for Ike common
Wrnce and general welfare of the I'nitsd States."" si;
But Congress has not this power, if the obsta- ci
les of slavery may be put in the way of its exer- rij
ise. A man cannot be said to have law for ?r
Iriving his carriage through the streets, if an- u|
ither man has law for blocking its wheels. If Tl
he States may establish tho most atrocious ti<
irrongs within tlicir borders, and thus create an tit
tmosphere, in which the Federal Government er
annot ""live ami move ami have its being;"" in
hen, within those borders, the Federal Govern- th
sent may be rcdncod to a nullity. The power th
eferred to in this clause Congress will never is
ave faithfully exercised, ao long aa it loaves ti<
lillions of foes in the bosom of our country. F<
iy enrolling tho slaves in the militia, and yield- te
ig to their Constitutional right 44 to keep and in
ear arms*'?which is, in effect, to abolish sla- la
ery?Congress would convert those foes into th
riends. Tho power in question, Patrick Henry, C<
iho was then the orator of America, held to be te
uflicient for abolishing slavery. In the Virginia of
'onvention, which passed upon the Federal Con- er
titution, Mr. Henry said: ""May Congress not of
say, that every black man must fight ? Hid we te
not see a little of this, the last war? We wete of
not so hard pushed-as to make emancipation se
general. But acts of Assembly pa.ssed. that m
every slave, who would go to the army, should hi
be free. Another thing will contribute to bring in
this event about. Slavery is detested. We feel at
un iniai eiioeis. wo nepiore it with all the pity ti<
of humanity. Let all theso considerations. at se
gome future period, press with full fore# on ill# i?
minds of Congress. They will read that pa- ?i<
per, (the Constitution,) and see if they have w
power of manumission. And hare they not, of
sir? Have they not power to provide for the hi
general defence and welfare? May they not th
think, that they call for the abolition of slavery 1 of
liny they not pronounce all slaves free??and pc
will they not he warranted by thnt power?
There is no ambiguous implication or logical it
deduction. The paper speaks to (he point. They dc
hare the pott er in clear and unequivocal trriiis; to
and trill clearly and certainly exercise it.'' r<\
lid. ' Congress has power to impose e capitation Tl
ix."" m
Manifestly, Congress ran pay no respeet in this at
aso to the distinction of bond and free. It ran fo
jok for the payment of the tax to none other w
han the subjects of the tax. But if any of them w
o not own themselves, they cannot owe th# tax. th
'his clause implies, therefore, the self-ownership *f
f men, and not their ownership by others. *r
3d. ""Congress shall hare power to establish a tent- ti<
jrut rule of naturalization."" ('<
But this power, if faithfully exercised, is fatal th
d slavery. For, if our three millions and a halt in
f slaves aie not already citizens. Congress can, or
nder this power, make tliein such, at any time, ta
L can confer on them, as easily as on foreigners,
lie rights of citizenship. 1 add, that, had thei C<
lavcholdcrs wished, (as however they did not.) sp
t perpetuate slavery, they would, if they could, of
nve qualified this absolute and unlimited power ini
f naturalization, which the Constitution confers ' I
n Congress. 4 c
4th. ""The Congress shall have power to promote
ie progress of sctrnrr and useful arts by srettriug for by
niitcd times to authors and inventors the evehesus liu
ght to thrir respective writings and discoverers."" en
This clause clearly authorizes Congress to en- of
outage and reward the genius, as well of him. ini
ho is called a slave, as of any other person, he
fee person, as much as another, is entitled ^o a sa
opy-right of hia book and to a patent for his on
leritorious invention. Not so, however, if there tb<
lay be slavery. For the victim of slavery has an
o rights; and the productions of his mind, no on
>ss than the productions of his hands, belong to St
is master. on
5th. ""Congress shall hare power to declare war.
rant letters of ntargue and reprisal-?to raise and m<
tpport armies?to provide need maintain a nary."" an
It necessarily follows, from th# unconditional soi
nwer of Congress to carry on war, that it can an
intrart with whom it pleases?white or black, ha
nployer or employed?to fight ita battles; and no
in secure 10 earn ms wages, pension, or pms mi

ite power of Oongreas is tho claim of the ilare- it <

r the sailor, or soldier, whom he falls his slare. tin
6th. u The United Statu shall guaranty to erfry l'1<
late in this Union a republican form of government."" r',;
It is a common opinion, that the General Got- f
riment should not concern itself with the interill
policy and arrangements of a State. Rnt ^
lis opinion is not justified by the Constitution,
he case may occur, where the neglect thus to
incern itself would involve its own ruin, as well j
i the greatest wrong and distress to the people ^
""a State, lfow could the General Government ^

Bl&ckstonc pronounces this writ "" the most

of tho Constitution.'' One of his editors,
r. Christian, saya, that ""it ia this writ, which
akos slavery impossible in England."" Equally
(possible, in theory, doos it make slavery in
merica. And in both countries the impossibilf
springs from the fact, that the writ is entirely
compatible) with the claim of property in man.
1 the presence of such a claim, if valid, this
rit is impotent, for if property can las plead in I
io prisoner, (and possession is proof of owttetiip,)
the writ is defeated.
Slavery cannot be legalized short of auspeudg
the writ of habeas corpus, in the case of tho
arcs. But, inasmuch as the Constitution pro- I
des for no such suspension, there is no legal
a very in the nation.

real mistake to confound the laws, so called, by
hich persons arc held in slavery, with ""due

Justice Bronson says [Hill's Reports, IV, 1-ltf]
f this part of the Constitution :
"" 7he meaning of the ssctv/n then teem* to he, the.'
no member oj the State shall be disfranchised. ? n
deprived of any of hi.i right* or pnrileger, unless
the matter shall be adjudged against htm, upon Iritil

He adds:
"" The words ' due process of law,' in this place
cannot mean loss than a prosecution or suit,
instituted and conducted, nccor ling to the pre- |
icrihcd forms and solemnities for ascertaining
guilt, or determining the title to property.""
Lord Coke explains "" due process of law '* to
?, ""by indictment or presentment of good and
lawful men, where such deeds he done in duo
manner, or by suit original of tho common
taw.""
The defenders of the Constitutionality of State
avery are drivcu to the position, that suoh spcfic
denials of tho definition an.l violation of
glits, as 1 have just quoted from of the
nendments of tho Constitution, are limitations
>on the power of the Federal Government only.
io# say, that it is to he inferred, that the limila>ns
are on Federal power, when the C'onstitn?n
does not point out whether they are on Ifedal
or State power. Whence, however, is this
ferenco justified ? From the fact, it is answered,
at the Federal power is the subject-matter ot
o Constitution ? is that, of which it treats ?
that, which it constitutes. Hut the Constitu>n
is a paper, not merely for establishing the
fder.tl Government, au.l prescribing its charm r
and limits. It is. also, a paper for detenning
the boundaries of Stale authority. And tho
tter purpose is no legs important, or neceoeary,
an tho former. Happily, however, the original
institution left nothing to infrreuco in this matr.
It does not need a more frequent recurrenco I
the word ' Congress"" in thern, to make it.
itirely plain, that the eighth an.1 ninth section.<

etion of this article is taken up with the en titration
of the disabilities of the States. I
ire seen an old cop\ of tba Constitution, printed
Virginia, in which "" Powers of Congress"" is )
, the head of the eighth section, and "" lleetriedus

ction. and "" Restrictions upon respective .Stslr*. ' '*
at the head of the tenth section. Tlio repetinn
of the word ""State,"" in the tenth section, J
ould have been as unnecessary as the repetition
'the word ""Congress"" in the uinth section,
id the denial of State powers been preceded 1.
? enumeration of State powers, aa is the denial
Federal powers by the enumeration of Federal
nvera. jj
So far, then, a? these sections are eeawnwd, ,{
is not left to the loosenasa of inferenrs to
'termine whether the Constitution is applicable
a State, or to the Nation. ?tne of the section"" I
mains limitations 011 the Federal Government.
ie next contains limitations on another liorernent?mother
Government. since the latter limitions
are, to some extent, identical with the
rruer, and would, of course, not be repeated,
ere bnt one. Government in view. What, bower,
bnt a State Government, eould this other
overuinent be? And yet. to avoid all necessity
inference, the word ""State"" is repeated sovnl
times in connection with these latter limits >ns.
Aud, now, we ask where in the original
institution, either before or after the three sec- ( <J
ins. which we have referred to, is it left to b?*
fcrred, whether the powers granted are National
5tntc powers? Nowhere is there such nncerinty.
I
We will now take up the amendment* of the
institution. It is in them, that we find those ,
erifir denials of the deprivation and violation
rights, which forbid slavery?such denials, for
stance, as that "" No person shall be deprived of
ife. or liberty, or property, w ithout duo proeeg*
if law.""
Twelve articles of amendment were on,1.0. i
the first Congress. The hrst threw ami the
it two do. in terms, apply to tho Federal Gov:iment,
ltd to that only. In the CMS of BHMl
the remaining seven, tlioir application is a
liter of inference. Whilst, lioworer. it would
gross violation gf the laws of inference to
(r. that they apply to the Federal Government
ly, it would l.e in perfect tCMTtUM itli fl
sac laws to say, that, inasmuch aa a part of the
lendmenta refer expressly to that Government
ly, the remainder refer to both the Federal ami
ate Governments, or to Slate Governments
IWanee the first one of the adopted amend>nts
refers expressly to the Federal Government,
d to that only, there are, prohnbly, many perns,
who take it for granted, that the other
lendments follow this lead of the first, and
ve the same referem a as the first. They would
t take this for granted, however, did they know,
it this fust of the adopted am.mlmente was
? third of the proposed amendment* ; ami that
rime to he numbered the first, only heransn
? preceding two were rejected. It is entitled,
trefore, to give no lead and no complexion to

ision is not woakened, but strengthened, bf
j fact. that these two amendment* both cx>s*ly
referred to the Fedora! Government. I
nld here add. what may not he known to *11,
it the eleventh and twelfth of the adopted
icndment* were proposed hy Congress after the
ler ten were adopted.
In addition to the reason we have given, why
part of the amendments of the Constitution
er either to the Swite Governments exclusively,
to both tiie Federal and Plate Government*,
that, which arises from the fai t. that they are,
their nature and meaning, as applicable to a |
ite Government, ae to the Federal Government.
say, that such amendments, as the aecond, Jw
rd. and fonrth, were not intended to apply to
! whole nation, and woe intended to apply
ly to the little handful of persons under the
lnsive jurisdiction of the federal (mvoriiuicut.
to ist what cannot l?e defended. Again, if
>re he only a reasonable ilcubt, that the
h amendment refers exclusively to the Federal
vernment, it should he construed, as referring
State Governments also; for human liberty is
itled to the lienefit of every reasonable doubt ;
t this is a case in which human lihertv is

W have no right to go ont of the Constitrt

our fathers did, or did not. on this two-fold application.
Being prohibitions on the < lovernmeut
of a Stat*. a? h oil u on the National Government,
we mast, in the name of religion and rouaou,
of God and man, protest against limiting
the prohibition to the National Government for
the exceedingly wicked purjiose of ?ont:uuing
the bondage of miliious of our fellow-mou.
Had we the right, by reason of any obscurity
in the teachings of the Constitution on the point
under consideration, or from any other cause, to
go into collateral evidences of tha character of
theae teachings, we should find our interpretation
not weakened, but confirmed.
Nearly all the amendments of th? Constitution,
and, indeed, all of them, which concern our
present argument, were taken from the Bill of
Rights, which the Virginia Convention proposed
to have incorporated with the Federal Constitution.
But. inasmuch as this Bill of Rights speaks
neither of Congress. nor the Federal Government,
ita language is to l>e construed,as no less applicable
to a State than to the Nation, as providing
security no less against the abuse of State power
than Federal power.
Again: in the Congress, which submitted the
amendments, Mr. Maoiaoa was the first person
to more in the matter. He proposed two scries
ot amendments, uut of them affecting Federal,
and too other Stato powers. llis proposition
provided to have them interwoven iu the original
Constitution. For instance, the negations
of Federal Power were to be included iu tlx
uiutb section of the flrwt article; and the negations
of State power in the tenth section of that
article. And, what is more, several of the
amendments, which he proposed to include in
this tenth section, are, not only in substance, but
almost precisely in letter, identical with amendments,
which bee am # a part of the Constitution.
It was in the following words, that Mr. Msoiaos
justified his proposition to restraiu the Btatcs :
"" I think thers is more danger of these powers
' being abused by the Stale (roveromenta than
4 by Lhe (jloveniuieut of the Cnited States.'' "" It
' must be admitted on all hands, that the State
* Governments are as liable to attack those inval'
unable privileges, as the General Government is,
' ami therefore ought to be as cautiously guarded
against.'* ' I should, therefore, wish to extend
' this interdiction, and add, that no State shall
4 violate,'' Ac. if thers w.is any reason to restrain
the Government of the I'niled States from
infringing upon these essential rights, it was
equally necessary that they should be secured
against the State Governments. He thought,
that if they provided against the one, it was as
necessary to provide against the other, and was 1
satisfied, that it would be equally grateful to the
people.
The House of Representative# did not adopt
klr. ilxnisos a plan of distributing the amendments
through the original Constitution, and
fltllii uYlirracIv dto.lwinfr mi* Li llkA PAilftrAl <4rnl
another to a Stale Government. On the con- I
tru' j, it made tbetn a supplement to the original '
(.Vmilitalioo, and left a part of them couched in
??-nus, that render thorn equally applicable either
to one Government or the other. It must not be
tbrguttea, that Mr. Maoihox's plan was embodied
iu the rej?ort of a committer, and vat kept before
the Uoitse, for a long Um?. Nor must it be forgotten,
that whatever mar have been said by this |
or that speaker, in respec t to the application of j
this or that amendment, no rote was taken de- I
daring, that all, or. iudeed. anjr of the amend- J
monts apply to the General Government. What, '
however, is still more memorable is, that there .
was a vote taken, which shows, that the House
did not mean to hare all the amendments applr
to the General Government only. The vote was
!ou the following proposed amendment: ""No per'
sou shall lie snhject, in raae of impeaehmeut. to
' more than one trial, or one punishment for tho
' same offetire, nor shall t?e compelled to he a
' witness against himself, nor be deprived of life.
' lit>erty, or projasrty, withont duo process of
faw,"" Ac. Mr. Partridge, of Massachusetts,
*nove<l to insert after ' sarn,# offence"" the words:
"" by any law of the I'uited States.'' His motion
failed: and its failure proved, that the House
would restrain a State, as well as the Nation, from
such oppression.
iji the Senate sat with cloied doors, we know
nothing of its proceedings in r?>apect br tho
amendments, except that it concurred with the j
House iu recommending them.
I will say no more iu regard to the meaning of
the amendments. Is it claimed, tii&t if the original
Constitution is pro-slavery and tho amendments
anti-slavery, the original Constitution shall
prevail against the amendments ? As well might
it he claimed to reverse the rule in the case of a
will and to hare itw repugnant language prevail s
. _ aga4tmtthecodic.il. The amendments of the Con- |
sdtntion. are the codicils of the Constitution;
end if anvwhero the? coutiict with it. the Coasti- I
tution must yield.
! have, now. don*, no! only with the amendment*,
hut with the entire Constitution. Within
the compass of a single rjwerh, i could, of ,
course, rompriM but an outline of my argument.
I commend to my hearers the argument* of William
tioodell and Lysaudcr Spooner on this subject
It must be very difficult for an intelligent j
person to rise from the candid reading of Mr. j
SfHHiner'e book, entitled ""The rnronetiluliouehty
of Slavery,"" without l>eiiig convinced, by iu
unsurpassed logic, that American slavery finds
no protection iu the Constitution.
I said, that I Lave, now, done with the Constitution.
I believe, I aui warranted in adding, |
1' that I liavo reached '.he conclusion, that there is
power iu the Constitution to abolish every part
of American slavery. Is it said, that this conclu- J
Fiou. notwithstanding the manifest logical necessity
for arriving at it. is, nevertheless, not sound*
t>ue of the objection* to its soundness?via : that i
ibe slaveholders could never have consented to J
adopt a Constitution of such anti-slavery pow- j
. ore? 1 have already replied to, by saying, that j
the slaveholders of that day. being against the |
continuance of slavery, and the slaveholders of i
1 his day for it. the former cannot be judged of in j
the ligbt of the character of the latter. To this i
I add. that wiiatevei were the slaveholders of
that day, and whatever wore their motives in
wdopliug an anti-slavery Constitution, they, :
nevorthides, did adopt it, just as it is?-anti- j
slat cry as it is. The other principal objectiou to J
the soundness of tny Conclusion is, that neither ;
slaveholders nor non-slaveholders would have
consented to adopt a Constitution, which annihilates
Mate sovereignty. My answer to the latter
objection is, that the States are not sovereign, I
I and wete not intruded by the Constitution to be
sovereign. The simple truth is, that our fathers
refused to repeat the experiment of a Confederacy
of Stat*# ; and that, instead of it, they devised
for themselves and their Dostrritv a (>nr- t
eminent, which is. altogether, too broad and '
ibiuditig to consist wiih Stale 8<aeroigutj. The
t'onstitution prescribes limits lo the State quite ,
too narrow for the |dar of sovereignly. It doilies
the State many specific powers, each of
which 18 vital to sovereignty. For instance, It [
restrains it froin entering into a treaty; nnj from i
1 ruining money; au<l, if the power to deprive
"" of life, liberty, or property,"" is vital to sure- i
relgnty. then, aa we hare sern, the State is not
sovereign. because it liaa not this power. Our
, father* would not conaeut. that any section of
their fellow-men, with whom tliey had come
under a eotntnou (Jorernment, should outrage
essential human rights. Our fathers would not
fraternise with the people of &la.s**chuseus,
and yet allow them to plunder each other of
! property. j rsojr rouij not content to t>e on* people
with murderers, and, therefor*, the? would
uot Allow room for the PenuryIranians to tnrn
Tlittg*. And slavery, being worse than murder,
(for what intelligent parent would not rather
hare hi* children di*patched by the murderer,
than chained by the slaveholder ? ) ? slavery
lieing, indeed, the greatest wrong to man. of
which we ran conceive?our father* would not
font under the same Government with Virginians.
if Virginian* we,? u> be allowed to enplat
and boy and sell men. Hoe* th* Constitution
requiro us to remain bound up with Pennsylvania,
even though her policy i* to shoot all
her adnlt subjects. whoso stature falls below fne

I political brotherhood with Virginia, even though
she shall enslave all hor light-haired uuhje t*
(or, what is th* same in priuriplo,) all her darkskinned
subjects? So far from it, there is power
in tbat Constitution to hold hark Pennsylvania
and Virginia from the commission of the>e
Crimea.
Rvery person remembers ono part of the tenth
amendment ot the Constitution ; and every person
teems to hav* forgotten the other. Every
day do w* hoar, that powers are reserved by the
Constitution to the States; but, 110 day, do w*
iiear, that powers ar* ' prohibitod by it to the
.States."" Now. among those prohibited powers, i*
that of clasemg mcu with lioraes and hogs.
Let it not be implied from what 1 said, a niiuuts
ago, tbat I would admit th* competence of a State
Government to enslave its subjects, provided the
Federal Constitution had not curtailed its sovereignty.
No hnman Government, however unlimited
its sovereignty, ha* authority to reduce
man to a chattel?to transform immortality into
merchandise. And cannot I add with truth, and
without irreverence, that such authority comes
not within the limits even of the IliTine Government
7
Nor let it be implied, that I am iud""iflerent to
Stat* rights. I am sUenuou* for tlioir maiutonanue

law of God and the liiniLg of civil government. 4 8
It is, sometimes, said, that the amendment, 4 b
on which 1 have s|K>ken so extensively, refers to 4 t
criminal prosecutions only, But what if this 4 v
were so ? It would, nevertheless, cover the case
of the slave. You, surely, would not have a man ru
stripped of his liberty, ay, and of his manhood 8p<
too, who is not charged with crime.. The Gov- Bu
eminent, which says, that it will make hint, who th<
is not a criminal, a slave, confcsdes itself to be thi
unalterably unjust and base. inl
The Constitution, as has been seen in the course
of my argument, forbids slavery. Its pro-slavery Bu
character has been assumed. What is there, in- be
deed, that will make for itself, that slavery does pa
not assume? No wonder! It is itself but a tio
I mere assumption ? and the most monstrous as- an
sumption. The only wonder is?and the sorrow on
is as great as the wonder?that the American cai
people should be in tho miserable, servile habit
of yielding to all these bare-faced assumptions of wo
slavery. The speakers on both aides of this bill as
have taken it for granted, that the Constitution wb
is pro-slavery:?and when the honorable gentle- a 1
man of North Caroliua [Mr. Clinumax] coolly nm
j said : 44 Every single provision in that instrument, iui]
4 (the Constitution.) is pro-slavery?that is, for to
4 the protection and defence and increase of sla- gi*
4 very,"" no - one eeemed to doubt the truth of the
what he wks saying, any more than if he had mo
been reading Christ s Sermon on the Mount. I n
Aud. vet. the instrument, of which the honorable me
gout Ionian affirmed all this, refused to pollute nib
j its pages with tho word ""slavery.'' or even bet
with a word, (servitude. I which niiirht. nossiblv. tin

to the times of Lord Coke, we find him quoting ser
many cases, in which it was held, thai the com- Sel
non law, or. in other words, common sense, or ens

I would add, in tlm connexion, that the pror- |n
lnce of a human legislature does uot extend even 13 1
to all lawful and innocent things. That it is com- P*
mensurate with the whole field of human inter- *?,
oiii and obligations, is a verr great, though a xr?!
very common mistake. It covers lint a small <^'1
portion of that field. Not only are crimes inca- tapable
of being legalised, but there are number- e<t
less relations and duties, which are ever to be no
held saeied from tho invasion and control of the
human legislature. For instance, what we shall s'l:
cat ami Wear is a subject foreign to buman legis- n,(
lation. What shall bo the character of the in- t'li
terrourso between parent and child is no loss so. *n

ad. Law is not an absurdity. Lilt is one with
reason. Hence, in point of fact, a legislature
cannot make law. Ij can declare what is law.
It can legislate in behalf of that only, which is
already law. Legislation for liberty may las rft
law, because liberty itself is law. But legis- ,'1'

slavery is not/law. That cannot be law, ftH

case of a man is. that he is a man. Tho great
fundamental and controlling law in the case of a m>
horse is. that lie is a horse. The great, fundamental

and far more emphatically, all legislation, which 18
proceeds on the assumption, that a man is a

ory, is the conversion of men into things. It

That no one can honestly recognize a law for

on, ere dooming their fellow-men to the pit of

If. then, I am right in'saying, that men cannot

riONAL ERA, WASE
there is not, in all the broad earth, one pro-slavery
man: but that every man, when called to
make his bed in the hell of slavery, betrays, in the
agonies of his soul and the quaking of his limbs,
the fact, that he is a thorough abolitionist:?if, I
say, I am right in all this, then does it irresistibly
follow, that 1 am also right, in my position, that
thshb CAS HM NO LAW, BITHUR FOB AmKKICAH, Oil
asy othsb Slavsby. I am right in this position,
because, that, by no reasonable theory, or definition,
of law, can that be called law, which is
incapable of being admiiflktered honestly. The
fact, that men must necessarily be dishonest In
carrying it out, is, of itself, the most eonclusive
and triumphant argument, that it is not law. To
take the opposite ground, and to claim, that to be
law, whioh every man, when properly tested, denies
is law, is to insult all trne law, and Him, who
is the source of all true law. I conclude, under
this head, with the remark, that, the question,
whether slavery is, or is not to be known as law,
resolves itself into a question of simple honesty.
I must say a few words to protect what I have
said from the misapprehension, that I counsel
trampling on all wrong legislation. I am very
far from giving such counsel. No wrong legislation,
that is at all endurable, would I resist. And,
I add, that 1 would be patient with almost overy
degree of wrong legislation, provided it is legislation
in behalf of what is lawful, and of what it is
competent to legislate upon. Imprisonment for
debt is wrong legislation?very wrong and very
cruel legislation. Hut, inasmuch as the relation
of debtor and creditor comes within the cognizance
of the legislature, 1 will not treat such legislation
as void. Tlia legislature has a right end
in viow. It is to help the creditor get jnsticc.
Its error consists in selecting wrong means to this
end; and in putting a wrong remedy into the
hands of the creditor. I am to treat this action
of the legislature as a mistake?and a mistake,
which 1 am not to go beyond the limits of persnasron
to seek to correct. The paying of one's
debts is justice?-is law. Enactment* to enforce
this justice and this law may, some of them, ha
improper?such as compiling payment by tlie
terrors of imprisonment. But, as they ara enact
menta to enforce justice and what la itaeJf law,
1 must be rorj alow to denounce them, as no
law. So, too. if tny Government declare war
against a nation?I ain not to treat the Government,
nor the declaration, however unjust it may
he, with contempt. 1 mail remember, that Government
haa jurisdiction of national controTeesi
ee. and that the redress of national wronga ia
justice?ia law. Government ma/ err in ha modes
of redreea. It maj reeort to the aword, when
it ahould confine itself to the exertion of moral
influence. The cauae, nevertheless, which it ia
prosecuting, may le on# of unoiingled justice,
biko every good eanee, it maj itaelf ha law; and,
therefore, Government would not he chargeable
with impertinence and uaurpation for taking it in
hand. But, how different from all thia ia it, when
Government aete up slavery! In that coae, the
Btihject matter of lie action ia, moat emphaticallj,
not law. In that eeae. most emphatioelly, it haa
gone bejond ite province. To Government belongs
the adjustment of the relations between
creditor and debtor; and it ia for Govornineut to
dispose of UAtional coutroversiee. But, when
Government, undertakes the crime and absnrditj
ut turning tnon into things?of chattellizing, instead
of protecting, a portion of ita subjects?it
Lb, then, as far out of ita place, aa it can he. To
Biich an outrage, no submission ia due. It is to
he resisted, at everj hazard. To trample upon
inch lawlessness is to l>o Law-abiding, instead of
law-hreakiug. To rebel against such a Government
is not to be revolutionary and inohocratir.
The Government itself is the revolutionary and
mobocratic party If the decree shoold go forth
from onr Government, that our Irish population
bo murdered, the decree would, of course, be
trodden under foot. But who denies, that If
should be as promptly and indignantly trodden
under foot, were ita decree for their enslavement?

ko law for Ambrioak bi.atbst, hpt that thbiib
oa* bh so law, bithkr for ailrbioas, or ast
otb br blatunr, is BsoHD. It is in place, however,
to say, that tho recognition by the American
people of alavory &* l?w, is, of itself, sufficient
to Recount for their low of reverence for law.
This re Terence is, necessarily, deetroyed by the
habit of confounding shain law with true law?
by the habit, of accepting, as law, the mere forms
of law, where justice, truth, reason, anil erery
element, which goes to make up the soul of law,
is lacking. This rererence must soon die out of
(he heart of the people, who treat, as law, that,
which they know, is not law; who, in the holy
and commanding nanio of law, buy and sell, or
sanction tho buying snd selling, of their fellowmen;
and who, in all their life, lire out the
debasing lie, that so monstrous and diabolical a
thing, as slavery, is entitled to the shelter and
honor of law. This rererence is little felt by
those, who yield to the at*urdity, that law and
nature are opposite to each other; and that,
whilst, by nature, a man is an immortal, by law
he may be hut a thing. It is little felt by those,
who regard law as a mere conrentionalisin, which
may be one thing in one place, and another in
another; one thing at one period, and another at
another. They, and they only, hare adequate
and adoring conceptions of law, who believe, that
it is ono with nature, and thAt it is the same in
erery part of the earth, in every period of time,
and ""eternal in the heavens."" They, anil they
only, have such conceptions, who, instead of regarding
law as synonymous with *11 the onactmente
of foolish and wicked men, identify it with
unchangeable and everlasting right.
How. for instance, can the American people
perceive the beauty and preciousness of law,
whilst recognising, as law, the fugitive slave
act T?and whilst stigmatizing, and persecuting
the handful of men, who have the integrity and
the bravery to resist it? Why should not that
handful fly as swift to the rescue of their brother,
who ia in peril of being reduced to slavery, as ts>
the rescue of their brother, who cries: ""Murder? *
Ten thousand enactments for murder would not
hinder thcin in the lattei case. Ten thousand
enactments for slarery should not hinder them,
in the former. In each case, the rescue would
be not by a mob; but from a mob.
It has, now, been shown, that the .American
Government has authority, both inside and outside
of the Constitution?as well in natural and
universal law, as in conventional and national
law?to sweep away tha whole of American slavery.
Will it avail itself of this authority to do
this work? 1 ask not whether Government will
show pity to the slave?for 1 look not to Uovennneut
to be pitiful to the slave, or to any
other innn. I look to Government for sterner
qualities than pity. My idea of a trus (Jovernment
is realised, only in proportion, as the Goeeruinent
is characterized by wisdom, integrity,
strengih.N To bold even the scales of justice
among all its subjects, and between thein and all
other men ; and to strike down 1he hand, that
would make them uneven?this, and this only,
is the appropriate work of Government1
asked, whether the Ameriran Government
will abolish slavery. I confess, that my hope,
that it will, is not strong. The slave-owners
have the control of this nation, and 1 fear, that
they will keep it. It is true, that they are a
comparative handful in the vast American population
; and that, numbering only three hundred
thousand, their calling themselves "" ths South'*
Is an affectation as absurd and ridicnlous, as it
would be for the manufacturers of the North to
rail themselves ""the North,"" rtr the rumsellers of
the North to rail themselves ""th# North."" It is
true, that their interests are alien, as well from
the interests of ths South, as from the interests of
the North ; and that slavery is tha deadly foe, as
well of the white population of the South, as of
its black population. Nevertheless, in the present
corrupt state or ttie public sentiment, the slaveownert
are able to-control the aation. They are
mighty by their oneness. Divided tliey may he
in everything else?but they are undivided in
their support of slavery. The Slate and the
Church are both in their hands. A bastard
democracy, accommodated to the demands of
slavery, and tolerating the traffic in human flesh,
is our national democracy : and a bastard Christianity,
which endorses this bastard democracy,
is the current Christianity of our nation. The
fatherhood of Cod and the brotherhood of man?
ideas, so prominent in a true democracy and a
true Christianity?are quite foreign to our sham
democracy and onr sham Christianity. American
religion is a huge hypocrisy. Whilst to the immeasurable
siufulness of that system, which forbids
marriage, and the reading of the Bible, and
which markets men as beasts, it is blind as a bat,
it, nevertheless, draws down its stupid face, and
pronounces the shifting of the foet to music to
be a great sin. The different States of Christendom,
aa they advance iu civilisation and the
knowledge of human rights, are, one after another,
putting away slavery. liven the Bey of Tunis
puts away this most foul and guilty thing: and
says, that he doee so "" for the glory of mankind,
and to distinguish them from the brute creation.""
But America, poor slavery-ridden and slaverycursed
America, retrogrades. Whilst other nations
grow in regard for human rights, she grows
in contempt for them. Whilst other nations rise
iu the sunlight of civili/jttion, she sinks in the
night of barbarism. Iier Congross sets np slavery
in her very Capital. Ber Congress regvilatos
and protects the coastwise trad# in slaves. Her
Congress wages unprovoked and plundering wars
for the extension of slavery. Her Congress decrees,
that slaveholders shall have the range of
all America, in which to rednce men, women,
and children, to slavery. And her President, who
Mills slavery an ""admitted right,"" was shameless.
[INGTON, D. C., MA1
enough to say, in hi^ Inaugural, that the Fugitive
Slave Act, which his predecessor was shameless
enough to sign, should be ""cheerfully"" enforced.
In short, the Federal Government is now, and
long has besn, at work, more to uphold slavery
than to do anything else, or even ail things else.
The great slave-catcher ! the groat watch-dog of
slavery 1?these are its most fitting names, in its
preeont employment and degradation. And, yet,
notwithstanding all this devotion of the Federal
Government to slavery, and the iron determination
of the slave-owners, that the power of the
whole nation shall be exerted to uphold It; there,
nevertheless, can be no remonstrance from the
North against slavery, which is not immediately
followed by the truthless and impudent reply,
that the North has nothing to do with slavery i
That the American people and American Government
have fallen to what they are, is not to be
wondered at. It is but the natural and necessary
result of their having fostered and fed, for more
than half a century, the monster slavery. Time
was, wheu we might have crushed this monster.
But, now, it has crushed us. It has corrupted
us to such an extent, that there is scarcely a
sound spot left in us, at which to begin to rally
opposition to it. On no cheaper condition than
this can slavery be clung to. If we will he slaveholders?and
such are the Northern as well as the
Southern people?for if the dave-ownrr* are at tho
South, the people of the North are, nevertheless,
luore emphatically, because more efficiently, tho
?htv?hokkrt, than aro the people of the South?if,
I sAy, wa will be slaveholders, wo must take the
evil consequences upon our own understandings
and hearts, and not bo surprised at thorn. Men
cannot bind the degrading chain of slavery
around their brothers without at the same time
binding and degrading themseltea with it.
How melancholy upon our country, and,
through her, upon the world, has been the influence
of American slavery ! In the beginning of
our national existence, we were the moral and
political light-house of the world. The nations,
* which sat in darkness, saw the great light,""
and rejoiced. Nad to say, we were ourselves the
first to dim that light I The principles, which we
then enunciated, electrified the nations. Sad to
say, we were ourselves the first to dishonor those

has gathered darkness upon that light.
Nothing, so much as American slavery, has
brought disgrace upon those principle*. All other
causes combined hava not stood so effectually in
the waj of the progress of republicanism, as the
glaring inconsistency of our deeds with our professions.
In the house of her friends, Liberty has
received her deepest stabs. All our boasts and
falsehoods to the ooutrarj notwithstanding, there
is no Gorormuout on the face of the earth so
quick as our owu, to droad, and to oppose, popular
movement* iu behalf of liberty and republicanism.
Ou our Governmeut, more than ou all other
causes put together, rests the responsibility of
the stopping of the Revolution in the Spanish
American States. We are wont to any, that
tho people of those States were incompetent to
jterfrct that Revolution. This is a piece of our
hypocrisy. The instructions of our Government
aud the discussions in our National Legislature,
in regard to the Congress of Panama; our threat
of war against Colombia and Mexico, if those
States persevered in carrying forward tho Revolution
; and, above all, our baao supplication to
Russia and Spain to join us in stopping the wheels
of that Revolution; prove conclusively, that
though our lying lips were for liberty, our hearts,
all the time, were concerned but for the protection
of slavery. And, in the case of Hay ti?how deadly,
from first to last, has been tho enmity of our
Government to the oouse of liberty and repubcan
ism ! To learn tho extent of that enmity, we
ninst not coufiue our eve to the haughty and persevering
refusal of our Government to recognise

other thing* also?and eepecinlly at the servilo
compliance <rf onr Government with the impudent
and arrogant demand of Hapoleon to carry out
hii plan of starving the FTajtiena into submission.
(>nr Government made a display of sympathy
with the Rtiropean Revolutions of 1848. But who
Is so stupid, aa to accord sincerity to that display,
when he recollect*, that the very first fruit of the
very first of these Revolutions was the unqualified
abolition of all French slavery?and a part of
that slavery in the neighborhood of our own ?
So eager was our Government to appear to be on
the side of Hungary, thai it sent out a ship for
Kossuth. But, long ore he had reached our
shores; and, especially, whilst he was making his
speeches in Hngland in behalf of the equal rights
of all men ; our Government found out, that it had
got more than it contracted for. Kossuth's priiveiplee
wero too radical. Their scope was quite
too sweeping. They no more spared slavery thai:
any other form of oppression. Yet, Government
could not stop Kossuth on his way. Having
started for A jo erica, he must be suffered to come
to America. But how great his disappointment,
on his arrival! "" He came unto his own, and bis
own received him not.'1 The poor man was willing
to compromise matters. A thousand pities,
that he was. He was willing to ignore slavery,
and to go through the whole length and breadth
of the land, seeing, iu every man he mot, nothing
else than a glorious freeman. Alas, what a mistake!
The policy of the Government ""to give
him the oold shoulder"" was fixed; and no concessions
or humiliations on his part conld suffice
to repeal it. Kossnth left America?and he left
it, no less abundantly than painfully convinced,
that America is one thing in the Declaration of
Independence, and another in what has succeed- (
ed it; one thing in her professions, and another
in her practice. Will Mav.sini need to come to
Amorica to learn this lesson? And. if he comes,
will he stoop to repeat Kossnth's mistakes f
Thank God ! kfaar.ini has already identified himself
with the Americau abolitionists. May he
find himself rewarded by their eordial ideutificatiou
of themselves with the oppressed of Burope !
I confessed, that my hope is not strong, that
the American Government will abolish Americau
slavery. Far otherwise would it be. however, did
none, but slave-owners, Justify slavery. Tliey
would soon he converted, were it not, that the
mass of the American people fall in with them,
ami flatter them, ami cry peace, when there is no
peace. This is our great discouragement iu the
ease. The advocates of total abstinence are not
discouraged. They would be, however, if they
found the mass of the sober justifying drunkards,
and tolling them, that drunkenness is right.
I said, at an early stage of my remarks, that the
present attempt of slavery to clutch all the unorganised
territory of the nation affords a favorable
opportunity to freedom to push back the war into
the realm of slavery. I, however, did not add,
that the opportunity would be improved. Xor do
I add it now ;?for I am far from certain, that it
will he. For many years, I have had scarcely
any better hope for American slavery, than that
it would come to a violent and miserable eud.
Their habit of courting and worshipping the
slave-power, and of acquiescing in its demands,
has corrupted and paralysed the American peotle
to suoh a degree, as to leave little room to
ope, that they will bring slavery to a peaceful
and happy termination. I confess, some little
hope of such termination has heeu kindled in
me by thia new, surpriaing, and enormous demand
of the alave-power. 1 confess, that I have
thought it possible, that this demand might
arouse a spirit, which could he appeased by nothing
short of the overthrow of the whole system of
slavery. Should, however, such a spirit be
aroused, I r?ar it will not pervade the masses, hilt
will be confined to a few. It ia true, that meetings
are held, all over the free States, to protest
against the passage of this Rill; and that the
press of those States is almost universally against
it. Rut neither in the meetings, nor in the press,
do I see repentance. They nbonnd in indignation
toward perfidy:?bnt thej reveal no sorrow of the
North for the crimes of the North against liberty.
On the contrary, the meetings and the press do
well nigh universally justify the Compromise of
1820, and, in the great majority of instances, the
Compromise of 1850, ""Fugitive Slave* Act,"" and
all! Even iu sermons, preached against the Nebraska
Rill, 1 have seen the Fugitive Slave Act
justified. Now, the idea, that they, who can approve
of either of these Compromises, and especially
that they, who can, possibly, acquiesce in
the chasing down of men, women, and children,
for the purpose of casting them into the pit of
slavery?the idea, I say, that such persons will
perseveringly and effectively resist slavery, and
do faithful battle for it* overthrow, is to my mind
simply absurd. They, and they only, are to be
relied on for such service, who so loathe slavery,
that they would rather perish than do any of its
biddings, come those biddings from Congress, or
from Courts, or from any other sources.
Ami hid to strengthsn my hopo by looking at
the rapidly multiplying abolitionists ? I do look
at them: and this cheering sight is all, that,
under God, keeps my hopo alive. But I fear, that
they are too late. 1 fear, that the disease is past
enre. And I fear, too, that, even if w# are yet in
time to kill the Demon of Slavery, our falee and
pro-slavery education makes as so hesitating and
timid in hit terrific presence, that we shall not
wage direct, deep, and faUil war upon him, but
shall waste onr energies and onr only and swiftly
passing away opportunity in ineffectual skirmishes
and disgraceful dodgings. A few abolitionists
are consistent: and, were they not so few, they
would be formidable. They know no law for any
fraud; and, therefore, they will not know it for
the most stupendous fraud. They know no law
for any oppression ; and, therefore, they will know
none for the most sweeping oppression. Such
abolitionists are Garrison and Phillips, Ooodell
and Douglas* But most alwlitionretit, impliedly

if not directly, tac itly if not openly, acknowledge, t
that slavery can have, and actually lias, rights : \
and they are as respectful to these supposed v
rights, as if the subject of them were one of the (.
greatest earthly blessings, iustead of una of the u
greatsst earthly curses. *
It is true, that there is a political party in our c
country, organised against slavery; and that it \
numbers some two hundred thousand voters, t
among whom are some of ths noblest men in the i
land. And, yet, I look with well nigh as much e
sorrow, as hope, to this party. For so long as it i
recognizes slavery as law, I fear, that ,notwitli- (
standing its high and holy purposes, it will do
scarcely less to sanction and uphold slavery than j
to reproach and cast it down. Again, so long as 1
this party is swayed by such words of folly and a
delusion, as "" Si.atuky sectional : Freedom ha- d
tioxal,"" its admissions in favor of slavery cannot 1
fail to go far to outweigh all its endeavors against r
slavery. (

principles than thus* of the Liberty Part? will a
snfliee to bring down American slavery. Happy s
country this?happy North?happy South?if the 1
present aggresstvo movement of the slave-power f
shall result in bringing triumphant accessions to '
the Liberty Party 1 t
My fear, that the American Governments, 1
State or National, will not abolish slavery, is, iu r
no degree, abated by the fact, that several Huro- s
poan Governments have, in the present generation,
abolished it. It must be remembered, that 1
those Government* were exterior to, and independ- c
ent gf, the slave-power; and that they were not 5
trammelled by slaveholding constituencies. It is f
true, that slavery in Mexico was abolished by the t
Government in Mexico; and that slavery in South c
American States was abolished by the Govern- c
menu in those States. Hut it is also true, that 1
all this was done to promote the success of their j
Revolution and their deliverance from tho Gov- j
ernment of Spain. I doubt not, that even we, ,
closely as we cling to slavery, would, nevertheless, 1
abolish it, if urged to do so by the exigencies of war.
To ho]>e. that, because the Knglish Government
abolished slavory, our GovernmenU will also, is
untvise, in another point of view. Comparatively
disentangled with slavery as was England, slavery,
nevertheless, exerted well nigh enough
poVrer over her Government to prevent its successful
action against slavery. The party in the
interest of slaTerv was barelv defeated.
Let me no! be misunderstood. Let me not be [
supposed to fetw, that American slavery will not t
e^me to an end. My fear is, that it will not ?
be brought to an end by Government. I have no 1
fear, that it will not be abolished. It will be
abolished-?and at no distant day. If the Gov- 1
eminent* fail to abolish it, it will abolish itself.
The colored people of this nation, bond and free,
number four millions, and are multiplying rapidly.
They are ell viotims of slavery?for if the
free are not in the it/nbro, they are. nevertheless,
in the ftuutnbra, of slavery, llenre, then, as
well as by identity of race, they are bound together
by the strongest sympathy. Moreover, if
not carried along, as rapidly as others, nevertheless
they are carried along, in the general progressive
knowlodge of human rights. Such beiug
the case it is not to be supposed, that they can
be *\eld in thoir prosont condition, for ages longer.
Thf-y will deliver themselves, if they are not delivered.
lie must be blind to history, to philosophy,
to the natnre of man, who can suppose, that
such a system, as American slavery, can have a
long life, even in circumstances most favorable to
ite continuance. In the nfost benighted portions
of the earth, the victims of sueh a system would,
in procosi of time, come to such a sense of their
wrongs, and thoir power also, as to rise up and
throw oil' the system. Rut that, here, such a
sySlem must he hurried to its end, is certain.
For, hern, it is entirely out of harmony with all
the institutions around it, and with all the nr.>fessiotisof
those, who uphold it. Here it iecontinually
pressed upon by ten thousand influences adverse
to its existence. Nothing, so much as American
slavery, stands iu the way of the progress of the
age. A littletime longer, and it muit yield to
tiiis progress, and be numbered with the things,
that were. The only question it. whether it shall
die a peaceful, or a violent, death ? whether it
shall quietly recede before advancing truth, or
resist unto blood.
God forbid, that American slavery should come
to a violent end. I hold, with O'Connell, that no
revolution is worth the shedding of blood. A
violent end to American slavery would constitute
one of the bloodiest chapters in all the book of
time. It would be such a reckoning for deep
and damning wrongs?such an outbursting of
smothered and pent-up revenge, as living man
has never seen. Can this catastrophe be averted?
Perhaps, it cannot. Perhaps, God will not
let off this superlatively wicked nation on any
easier terms than a servile war?a war, we inuet
remember, that will he very like to bring within
its wide sweep t.he whole black population of
this continent and the neighboring islands ? a
population already numbering some ten or twelve
millions. Perhaps, since we would be a nation
of oppressors, lie will let the oppressed smite the
oppressors. Perhaps, since we would be a bloody '
nation. He will give us blood, even unto the
horee-hi idles."" There will be no such catastrophe,
however, if the North and the South,
equal sinners in the matter of slavery, shall
hasten to mingle the tears of their penitence;
to say from the heart: "" We are verily guilty
concerning our brother;"" and to join their hands I
in putting away their joint and nnsurp&ssed sin. I
I shall be blamed for having treated my sub- 1
ject in the light of so severe a morality. It will 1
be said, that economical views of it would have c
been more suitable and statesmanlike; and that r
I should have dwolt uik>? the gains to the slave- t
holder, and the gain* to the country, from the
abolition of elarery. I confess, that, had korscs
and oxen been the subject of mj speech, the field
of economy would hare been wide enough for
the range of my thought*, and the course of my
argumont. But I hare been speaking of men?of
niiiliou*.of immortals: and I hare been claiming,
that Government should lift them up out of their
chattelhood and their association with brutes:
and I could not so disparage the dignity, and to
sully the glory, of their manhood, es to claim the
performance of this high and holy duty, in the
name of money. When I see my fellow-man
reduced to a slave, I demand his deliverance,
simply because lie is a man. I cannot so wrong
his exalted nature and my own, and the Great
One, who made us in His own image, m to argue,
that money can be rnnde by surh deliverance. I
would as soon think of making a calculation of
pecuniary gains my argument in dissuading from
the crime of m order.
In saying, that I would not antler the duty of
delivering the slave to tnrn npon the question of
pecuniary gains and economical advantages, I
utter no peculiar doctrine. Who would suffer it
thus to turn, in any caee, where he regards such
victims as men? But, with me, all men are mon.
Are the skin and the mind of ray fellow-man
dark? ""A man's a man for a' that!"" I still
recognise him, as a man. He is my brothor: and j
I still hare a bruthet's heart for him. Suppose '
^
be Government of Pennsylvania had, the li
veok, reduced all the white people of Penns
ania. who have light hair, to slavery. Woi
'Ongn-ss let the present week expire, wiilu
ofeking their release? No! Would Congri
toop to ply that Government with urgumei
lrawn from political economy, arid to coax
vifli prospects of gain? Not no!?a tliuusu
imes no! It would demand their relouse: a
t would demand k, too, not in virtue of fee
irgumenta and humble authority;?but, Rtl:
kllen-like, in the name of God Almighty and 1
JongreM.
I shall bo blamed for not having brought oti
dan for getting rid of slavery. I confess, lbs
tare no other plan for getting rid of it but
ibolition?Ha unconditional, entire, and imn
liate abolition. The slave is robbed of his m;
lood, of himself, aud, consequently, of all
ights. There is no justice then?there is
lod then?if the restoration of his rights and 1
es to ration to himsolf can be innocently <x
litioned on anything, or innocently )>ost{H>ncd.
I shall be, especially, blamed for not havi
roposed compensation. I do not rcpudiatclever
have repudiated ? the doctrine of co
>enaatiou. Compensation for his services n
offerings would be due from the slaveholder
ho slavo ; but. clearly, no compensation for
estored liberty would bo due from the si*
o the slaveholder. I admit, however, that
p-eat debt would be duo, frotn the Americ

I am well aware, that, in reply to my adm
ion, that the American people should thus b
len themselves, it will be said, that slavery ii
{tate, jujd not a National concern ; and that ii
or the State Governments, and not for the }
ioual Oorernment, to dispose of it. I, eei tair
lo not deny, that, if slavery can be legalized
mr conutry, it niuet be under the State (.lore
nents only. Nererfheles3. 1 hold, that cr
lart of American slavery is the concern of er
iart of the American people, because the vvli
American peoplo and the American (Jorcrnm
tare, though in defiance of the Constituti
Tiade it such. And, as Ihcr have made it su
As (iannlxoDttltntnj of tilery, (as the phrase is vr

[f John Smith has built a distillery; and if
las, also, encouraged his neighbors to build h
t dov.en more; and, especially, if he bus palri
v.ed and profited by the half dovoa dietilleii
hen. his work of repentance is not all done, wl
is has broken up his distillory :?and, none
m>re is it all done, because it was contrary
aw, that he had a part in getting up and eusta
ng the half dov.en distilleries. The lU-Svtilh

hat has resulted from it, obviously fails to co
he whole ground of his duty, unless, indeed,
s proper, the dt-SvtUbmf is interpreted to m<

itwg of slavery, unless it be thus broadly r
ustly interpreted, fails short of the measure
;he duty of the nation. The nation, whet
lonetitutionally or unconstitu lion ally, has bi
i}> slavery: and, therefore, the nation should >
t, and pay to end it.
I said, that I shail he blemed for speaking i
.visely on tho subject of slavery. 1 add, tlia
ihall he blamed for speaking on It, at all.
ipoak against slavery in any manner, and. es
leciallv, in the national eouncile. is couslri
nto hostility to the Union :?and hostility to
,'nion is, in the eye of American patriotism,
nost odious of ail offonces?the most beinoui
U1 crimes.
I prize the Union, because I prise the wisdt
murage, philanthropy, and piety, of which it v
legotten. I prise it, because 1 prire the sig

prize it, because I prise its objects?those gr

iie object* of the Constitution. I prise it, for t
[reat power it has to honor God and bless mi
prise it, because I believe the day will eor
vhen thie power shall be exerted to this end.
Now, snrely, opposition to elavcrv cannot
loetilily to such a Union. 8noh a Union is i
lasailed, and cannot be endangered, by oppo

JTHE FKEHIAN-
For the Green Mou.ltaln Freeman.
To the Members of the late Congregation
al Convention of Vermont.
Respected Brethren: In my previous commu
nication, among other mutters, I took the position, that
three things only were originally necessary to abolish
American Slavery.
I. To convince the people that slavery odoht
TO BE ABOLISHED. .
II. To convince the people what each individu
al OUGHT TO DO, IN ORDER TO ITS ABOLITION.
The first proposition (we insisted,) has already re
ceived the sanction of public opinion universally, if we
except slaveholders and their apologists. Consequent
ly all efforts put forth hereafter in Vermont (or in the
free States even,) with a view to establish this point,
must necessarily be the ludicrous ""beating of the air,
the ""shaking of the bush,"" after the bird has been
caught and eaten. I offer this as a labor-saving sug
gestion, and one which I would not have named, were
it not for the fact, Unit very recently an anti-slavery
convert (not remarkably conversant with the history of
the cause) commenced his public career in behalf of
the slave with a discourse upon Jewish Abraiiamic
Slavery a discourse so very far ""behind llw limes,""
that it elicited the facetious (tho' friendly) remark, that
""by the time the worthy lecturer extends his anti
slavery march down as far as to the days of the apos
tles, slavery will be dead and buried.""
My second and third proposition I now propose to
discuss as briefly, and with as little attempt at rhetor
ical embellishment, as possible; hoping in this hum
ble effort not to gratify any feeling of vain ambition,
which I may possess, but rather to induce, if possible,
abler intellects and more philanthropic hearts to es
pouse a cause, which demands, and is fast enlisting
the sympathies and prayers and energies of the chris
tian world. Slavery in the United States is divisi
ble into two kinds, or classes, the non-observanco of
which distinction has occasioned much needless mis
understanding and profitless debate.
I. We have (what may properly be called) State
Slavery.
II. National Slavery.
The former depends for its existence, its legalised
being and support, upon the legislative action of the
individual States, in which it prevails. In some States
it claims the higher, protection of constitutional en
actment, the protection of the State Constitution.
Whereas our .alional slavery derives its original le
gal existence from an Act of Congress ; and the same
law still sustains it. When the Deed ot Cession of
the ""ten miles square"" took effect, that instant the
slave laws of Maryland and Virginia ceased their ope
rations within the ceded territory. Slavery then ceas
ed within the District. The former slaves were then
not only morally and naturally and righteously free,
but Uiey were legally free free in law and in right,
as free as the members of Congress, who re-enslaved
them who kidnapped them by Act of Congress, and
thus bound them and their posterity to the perpetual
despotism of the avaricious, lustful, Anglo-Saxon slave
holder, the bitterest despotism with which the Al
mighty ever suffered man to afflict his fellows. And
that same Slavery-creating law now remains upon
our national Statute book, a burning disgrace both to
the legislators, who treacherously placed it there, and
to the nation that has thus far unblushingly suffered it
there to remain.
Now let us inquire, how these two kinds of slavery
are to be met and abolished against what particular
branch of the system the men of Vermont are to make
their assault, and consequently what are the weapons
adavted to the war,
If slavery is ever peacefully terminated in these
United States, it must be dune either, 1st, by individa
al emancipation by the masters, 2d, by legislative en
actment of the slave States in the case of State slave
ry, and of Congress in the case of National slavery, or
3d, by the intei position of the National government in
cither its J udicial or Military departments. I can con
ceive of no other peaceable meUiod of effecting the
object, unless we include, as one, the ""under-ground
railroad-"" and I hardly think that any friend of this
process has the faith to believe that this can do more
than hasten the general emancipation by some of the
methods above named. Nor shall I take any further
notice of the third method specified, inasmuch as a
discussion of that branch of the subject can have no
bearing on the main question now under consideration,
to wit: Uie duties and obligations of the men of Ver
mont in relation to slavery. For our present purpose
then, the proposition stands thus : slavery, if peace
fully abolished, must be abolished eiUier by individu
al manumission, or by legislative enactment
Now 1 ask, where is the man, who, conversant with
the two hundred year's past history of slavery, yet pos
sesses so much charity for human nature, as to believe
that any one of these United States would ever, during
all time, be disencumbered of slavery, by the voluntary
act of the mosteis? Never can such an unearthly,
such a heavenly result be expected, until that better
time shall arrive, in Revelation foretold, when the prin
ciples of righteousness shall have supplanted the pur
poses of rapine, when wars and rumors of wars shall
have ceased, and ""there shall be none to hurt or des
troy in all God's holy mountain."" Not until profanity
and blasphemy and perjury and robbery and piracy
and murder Bhall have been voluntarily abandoned, and
the legal enactments in suppression of those crimes
become a dead letter upon the statute book of the land,
need one hope to see Uio slavery of a single State a
bandoncd voluntarily. Nay, it is self-evident, that
men, who can coolly and systematically prostitute the
principles and precepts and spirit of the blessed Bible
to Uie blasphemous desecration of sanctioning Amer
ican slavery (which alone violates each and every com
mand of the Decalogue) will relax their grasp upon
the throat of the slave never, until either the strong
arm of the law interposes in behalf of Uie quivering
victim, ordeath's icy fingers gather up the indurated
heart-strings of the merciless oppressor.
If. the assumption Uien is correct (as substantiated
by reason and experience both) that slavery will not
terminate by voluntary manumission, it follows, that it
must bs abolished by legislation j our national slavery
by Congress, and State slavery by State legislatures.
And if slavery is to be thus terminated, the duties
to be performed and the work to be done by the free
men of Vermont, are plain and obvious : so very man
ifest that Uie wayfaring man need not err in relation
thereto ; and I confess, that it seems almost like insul
ting the commonest understanding to pursue the sub
ject further. For it must be evident, if our national
slavery is to be abolished by Congress, we must have
a majority of the representatives and senators in Con
gress and a President who will favor such abolition,
such repeal of the slave laws, created by Congress.
And how shall such be the character of our President
and Congress, unless the electors in the several States
make it Buch by their votes at the town Ballot-boxes ?
Will your Congressional representative candidate vote
to repeal the national slavery? Will he (if elected)
vote for no one for President of the United States (in
case of no choice by the people) except for one who is
in favor of such repeal? If so, it is safe to vote for
such candidate. Will your town representative and
your County senatorial candidates vote right, when
they come to elect a United States Senator? If so,
they are of the right sort. Will your candidate for
Vice President vote right in case of atie in the Senate?
If so, vote for him. Will your Presidential candidate
refuse to sign a bill repealing the slave laws of Con
gress? If so, it is treason against the religion of God
and the rights of humanity to vote for such candidate,
or for electors who would do so.
Here then, Brethren, is the grand secret of the con
tinuation and the aggrandizement ot slavery. The
slave power, by its artful management in keeping the
two parties continually pitted against each other, on
the subject of ""We other great interests,"" has effectually
palsied the only instrumentality which can be brought
to bear effectually against slavery. The voting against
slavery has been suppressed. That weapon, which
under God is destined to break the power of the op
pressor in our land, has been ""locked in the scabbard""
by the foolishness, the wickedness of party strife.
Political party idolatry, is the great guardian shield,
behind which slavery has grown fat on the blood of its
victims, while the only hope of the slave's redemption
has boon suffered to be neglected and forgotten. Yes,
it is the peaceful little slip, the noiseless ballot, the
silent but omnipotent vote, this, this it is, which
God has given, with which to open the door of the
prisoner and let the captive go free.
"" A weapon, which comes down as still,
-As snow-flakes fall upon the sod,
And executes a freeman's will
As Lightning does the will of God.""
If these views are correct, when a servant of God
stands up before the groat congregation in discharge
of the sacred duties of his calling, and invokes Uie in
terposition of his great Master in behalf of tho slaves,
and that slavery may be brought to a speedy end,
what more is that, than the prayer that God would
operate upon the hearts of the people and induce them
to vote down slavery? And ought nut such servant,
then, who thus prays, to make manifest the sincerity
of his prayer by voting in consistency threwith ?
But, again, it is the duty of every freeman not only
to vote in the manner before named, but also to use
his whole influence to induce others to do the same.
Hence tho necessity of withdrawing all support and
countenance from every party which is not organized
upon the true and only anti slavery ground, to wit: to
support no man for any of the offices above mentioned,
unless he will use his whole constitutional power to
abolish slavery. The reason of this is too plain to
need illustration. In this, as in many other matters, it
is true that ""he that is not for us is against us;"" and
hence the command, to ""come out and be separate.""
And inasmuch as ""in union there is strength,"" it is the
duty of all who wish slavery terminated, to unite to
gether for the common purpose of operating against
the system more effectually. If all the members of
Uie various churches in our land, or even within the
'rce States,' would take the Bible as the rule of their
political action, there would be no necessity of any
new or different associations. Our churches would
all be anti slavery associations, and such, too, as would
demolish slavery without that opposition which the
friends of the cause have heretofore contended with
the opposition of the church itself the very severest,
the most distressing part of the anti slavery contest.
But all do not thus take the Bible as their guide; and
uence nas arisen tne necessity ot anotner organization;
and such is the Liberty Party, whose foundation is.
J the com. non brotherhood of man whose object is, the
redemption and elevation of the slave and whose rule
of action is, the Bible and the constitution. And
whenever this party shall be seduced to abandon their
great and glorious object, and to repudiate their heav
enly principles, and to return back again hungering
after the flesh-pots of Egypt, which they have once
forsaken, then and not till then) will it be time to
charge the party with corruption.
Thus have I attempted to speak of one branch of
labor necessary, indispensably necessary, for the peace
ful termination of slavery. I know that prayers, and ex
hortations, and entreaties are alo necessary, beside,
doubtless, other instrumentalities still. ""Prayer moves
the arm that moves the world."" But all these are but
so many agencies to bring men up to tike hold of Uie
great moral and religious (as well as political) lever,
voting, which is to upheave the blood-cemented sys
tem. State slavery, I have said, must be abolished by
the State legislatures. Any resolutions, any systems
of church discipline in reference to slavery and slave
holders, which we may adopt or devise, intended to
cause the individual slaveholder to manumit his slaves,
or tending to purify tho churches here in the free or in
the slave States, or calculated to incite men to politi
cal action, either in the slave States or the free, we
are bound to originate. The anti slavery torch,
wherever lit up, must be raised on high to shine.
There is darkness enough in this land of Bibles; God
knows it; the poor Blave, grinding in his chains
knows and feels it: the church of Heaven is buried
so far down beneath the wrecks caused by slavery, as
to barely see the light of day; and if Uiftre is any
light any where, which can relieve the oppressive
darkness of Uie scenery, let it be borne aloft! Let
its rays flash on Uie midnight around us. But still
it muBt ever be remembered , that voting, and that
only, can demolish the old Bastile of slavery.
Here I leave the first two points of the general prop
osition stated, to wit., that three Uiings only, were at
first requisite to abolish American slavery:
I. To convince the people that slavery ought to be
abolished.
II. To convince them what each one ought to do to
abolish it.
III. To persuade them to do what thet know to
be thftr nuTY in the matter.
My third point I leave for each individual to discuss
lor iuuiseit with his conscience ana wnn nis uoa.
Respectfully Yours, for the Oppressed,
Aug. 17, 1746. PHILEMON.
For ttit; Green Mountain Freeman.
The Western Democracy.
One of the most encouraging omens to the slave, is,
the symptoms of awakening manhood in the western
serviles. The great master overseer, Calhoun, has
cracked his whip in so many different directions, and
has become bo regardless of the cries of his boys, and
the fulfilment of the few small promises which was
deemed prudent to make, to secure perfect obedience,
that insubordination in the western division is prevail
ing to a great extent. They were hoaxed into the
support of Texas with the promise of Oregon, and
then laughed at for their folly. The Brinkerhoofs
and Wentworths began to murmur, and show the
white of their eyes. They denounced the duplicity of
Uieir masters. They would not be caught in that trap
again. But their services were required to establish
McKay's overseer tariff law. Naked promises of ap
propriations for western lakes, and rivers, and harbors,
would not bring them. So the bill was passed through
both houses, and lodged understandingly in the hands
of their chief. The west once more obeyed orders.
No sooner done than Mr. Polk claps his veto upon
their darling measure, and their hopes perish. The
south chuckle the west grumbles. Good. They
have got the slave's reward all Uiey deserved hard
work and no pay. And, like their southern brethren
in bonds, they show unmistakable Bigns of leaving
their master's service. The keystone is loosened,
ready to fall from the arch of despotism. The north
star of freedom begins to shine upon their pathway,
and may yet eclipse, to their vision, the lone star of
Texas. They can't again be whipped into the same
submissive harness. Serviles they will for a while
longer continue, but on different terms. Pay in ad
vance will henceforth be their motto. And as slavery
never would live, except by fraud, bo it wjjl loose all
its profits in legislation when it pays to the west the
price of its obedience. For every industrial interest,
and every other interest, except that of getting office
by the favors of the south of the free west is becom
ing more opposed to Uie interests of the slaveholders.
The south cannot live by favoring western interests
sufficiently to secure western obedience. The west
can take care of themselves cheaper than to hire the
south to take care of them. A forced union may exist
a while longer, cemented by the heat of party strife.
But a separation is inevitable. Sooner or later it must
come. Both parties know it; hence the anxiety of
slavery to extend her empire. She is sensible that the
ties of interest, affection and confidence, are fast sun
dering forever between them. The western leaders
have been goaded on by southern insolence to make
the admission. jAnd tho praries, and far distant west,
respond from every motive of interest and of freedom
to hasten their redemption from that base system of
vassalage which has checked their growth and paraly
zed Uieir energies thus far. Let the friends of free
dom take courage, the western Lion is rousing from
his lair, to execute the divorce, decreed by nature.

A Parallel Case,
A. says to B. ""You Liberty men have elected Polk
president, and got Texas into the Union.""
B. replies, ""I wholly deny your charge; we opposed
his election with our whole strength.""
A. ""You did not vote the Clay ticket, therefore Polk
was elected.""
B. ""I charge you, Mr. A., with doing me an essential
injury. My corn was pulled up and destroyed. I
supposed the crows did it, but now I can prove that
you did it""
A. ""I deny it, but prove it if you can.""
'You, Mr. A., might have been at my field and drove
off the crows and saved my corn; but you tarried at
home and attended to your own business and let the
crows work, and they destroyed my corn. Therefore
you did it""

Liberty or Slavery !
Unless the spirit that has been aroused in
New Hampshire, can be waked up in every
Free State of the Union, this nation is ru
ined. The experiment of a free government on the
American Continent will have proved a failure,
to the sad sorrow of the sons of Liberty every
where, and to the joy and comfort of tyrants
and despots the world over. Unless the friends
of Liberty in this land now rally and combine
forgetting every minor difference and all mat
ters of smaller moment conquest and slavery
will be triumphant. The felloes of Artillery
will plough fields now brown with harvest the
music of our water-wheels and spindles will be
drowned in the shrieks of the slave-coffle and
for the clang of the anvil and the work-shop,
will be heard the ring of the auctioneer's ham
mer. One strong, united effort, put forth now,
and Liberty may be safe. But it is now, or
never. Slavery is gaining new strength, new
courage, new hope, every day. Now, if ever,
is the fell spirit to be rebuked, and sent back to
his native pit
Fellow Citizens, shall this land become a
great kennel for the breeding and traffic of slaves!
This beautiful land. This mighty land. Stretch
ing from ocean to ocean, and from the frozeu
north to the very tropics. Rich in its mineral
wealth, beyond almost any other land of the
world. Rich in its agricultural resources be
yond comparison. Glorious in its mighty rivers
and its broad deep inland seas, and crowned
with glory in its majestic mountains, pillowing
their heads in the clouds and green to their very
summits with a rich verdure, and covered nil
over with herds and lowing cattle. Aland pur
chased with the life-blood of a great-hearted
ancestry. Say, fellow citizens, will you give it
up to the damning purposes of slavery? The
whole matter is in your hands. All power em
anates from the people. The rulers the infa
mous rulers, of this land, are but your servants.
The friends of slavery the propagators of des
potism, have combined for the sustenation rnd
spread of their darling institution. Friends of
Liberty and Justice and Humanity, lovers of
God and Man, will you cast aside everything!
else, and meet this naked question of Freedom
or Slavery, that is now being pressed upon you?
If so, the Republic is safe! If otherwise, if
the people of the north remain indifferent, or
foolishly waste their time and strength in conten
tion about the ten thousand matte is of small
consequence that divide us in rcligioui and po-
litical faith, the nation goes down. Goes down
infamously, through our recreancy and folly.
The slave power of this land is bent on the
conquest of the whole American Continent, and
its entile prostitution to the blighting curse of
slave labor and its subserviency to slave inter
ests! This is the question now before the Amer
ican people and about to he settled. We are
fearful of the result. Sixty year's union with
the blighting curse, seems to have palsied the
hearts of the people, and our old Anglo-Saxon
blood courses sluggishly through our veins.
Behold this infamous Mexican conquest. Why
are not the bells clanging in all our steeples,
and the people leaving harvest-field and work
shop, and flocking together to record their united
Protest against, the vile, traitorous, heaven-defying
action of this government?
Massachusetts State Liberty Address.
EXTRACT.
It is not easy to fill our minds with an ade
quate view of the responsibility which attaches
to the act of voting. It is by that act chiefly,
that the people govern. When you have given
jour vole, you have put the matter out of your
hands ; but yet you remain responsible to Heav
en and to Humanity for the consequences of that
vote. This is a serious view of the matter, and
it is just. Let those look to it, who made Ty
ler President, and enabled him to carry the an
nexation of Texas, all but the last act ; and to
station the army on the borders of Mexico,
which has produced the present war. Let those
bolt to it, whose votes made Polk President, to
carry out so consistently what his predecessor
had begun. It was the votes of freemen that
created those Senators, who made John C. Cal
houn Secretary of State by acclamation. It was
by voting that Winthrop was enabled to recant
the declared opposition of Massachusetts to the
deed of annexation, and the war which followed.
And votes placed Briggs in n position where he
could enrol our glorious Commonwealth as a vol
unteer, to display !ier patriotism in carrying on
this war of invasion and conquest against a sis
ter republic. Take care, then, fellow citizens,
how you vote. The accumulated public senti
ment of a whole year, like a great balance wheel,
expends its momentum by a single act, upon the
operation of our government and the destiny of
our country, beyond recall. See to it, then, that
your votes so record your will, that you will nev'
er have cause to regret them. The Liberty Par
ty are clear of the responsibility of these ming
led calamities and crimes, by having given all
their votes in unison with their declarations a-
gainst the authors of every one of these meas
ures, and against the party influences under
which these measures have been carried.
t
We shall not insult your understanding by
proceeding to prove that both the annexation of
Texas and the war which has followed it origin
ated with the slaveholders, and are the legiti
mate fruits of slavery. Texas was notoriously
annexed to strengthen slavery against abolition;
to create a wider market for the homebred slaves,
"" the vigintial crop"" of Virginia and the older
slave states ; to furnish a new soil for slave la
bor as fast as the curse of barrenness spreads
over the present slave territory ; and above all,
by a Bonapartean movement of overeeerisrn, by
the Slave Power, to cripple and confound the
politicians, parties and people of the country,
and produce a salutary awe of their despotic
masters, which may suppress even the utterance
of a desire to break away from their usurped do
minion. How completely they have succeeded,
let the craven spirit which now pervades Con
gress, let the tone even of the Boston press, tell.
And the conquests made in this war, lo which
you have been summoned by your own Execu
tive, will doubtless enure to the extension of the
dominion of slavery over all the territory that
may be acquired. Nothing can be more idle
than it is for papers and politicians, themselves
courting and supplicating the slaveholders, to
prattle about prohibiting the further extension of
slavery by the power of the United States, or
the admission of more slave States, as fast as
territories can furnish a scanty population. The
only influential opposition to the extension of
slavery, is that which puts slavery itself upon
the defensive, and drives it to the wall to strug
gle for its own existence.
The present posture of affairs furnishes over
whelming proof, were it needed, to satisfy every
reflecting mind of the utter incapacity of the
existing old parties, or either of them, to offer
any effectual resistance to the encroachments and
usurpations of the Slave Power. When we
speak of these parties, we mean to be under
stood cf their combined action as organized
parties, marshalled under certain leaders, and
struggling for certain objects in which slavehold
ers and non-slaveholders have a common inter
est. In both these parties, slaveholders rule with
absolute sway, and thus secure thr verification
of Mr, Clay's declaration, that neither of these
parties has any view to the emancipation of the
slaves as a part of its policy.
It shows, too, in the light of almost a centu
ry's experience, the insufficiency of our institu
tions to circumscribe this giant evil, or to pro
tect the liberties of the people against its en
croachments. From the clay wnen Jonn Ad
ams told Samuel Adams that it was necessary lo
give the South the command in order to secure
their fidelity to the infant revolution ; and espe
cially from the adoption of the present constitu
tion of our Union, the Slave Power has gone on
with a steady and continual progress of assump
tion, now using the Democratic party as its allies
to give it new conquests, and then employing
the conservative influence of the Anti-Demo
cratic party to secure its acquisitions. The ad
mission of Missouri and the annexation of Tex
as as Slave States, are but stages in its career of j
usurpation. For fifty-seven years the friends of
freedom have maintained an ineffectual strugi
in defence, but have been baffled in every in
stance, have never gained one victory, have been
continually driven back, have given the slave
holders first the balance and then the control
of the Senate, have grown weaker, and more
submissive, and less hopeful, until at length, on
the annexation of Texas, multitudes of North
ern men gave up in despair, and were ready to
agree to serve without complaint or resistance,
provided only, that the conquerors would merci
fully consent to spare them the pecuniary bene
fits of a protective tariff a few years longer.
Even this humiliating surrender has been treat
ed with scorn, and the blow which was so sla
vishly deprecated by the Whigs of New Eng
land and the Democrats of Pennsylvania, has
been struck by the slaveholders, without deign
ing a word of pity or explanation. There is no
longer any power left of giving further rerist
ance ; and the haughty overseers believe that
now they can have everything their own way.
There is no hope that the Free States can ev
er escape from this thraldom, but by a radical
change of policy on the subject of slavery. WE
MUST TAKE THE AGGRESSIVE! We
are driven back to the wall, and must turn. We
must henceforth unite in a firm resolve, not only
to resist the further encroachments of slavery,
but to employ the powers wnich the constitution
gives us, with inflexible firmness, to promote the
peaceful extinction of slavery itself. Here is
our only hope. Unless the non-slaveholders of
the country, North and South, can now be ral
lied on this ground, it is manifest that nothing
awaits us but a still deeper degradation, and a
still more disastrous domination of the Slave
Power. Have we not bowed down long enough?
The example of New Hampshire shows that the
people think so, and that they are ready now to
lay aside every other question, and unite on Anti-Slavery
ground, just as soon as their leaders
will let them. Now is the time aiid now the
hour to raise high the banner of the Liberty
party, which was organized six years ago foi
this very purpose, and which can never be turn
ed aside from its one object, THE PEACE
FUL AND CONSTITUTIONAL ABOLI
TION OF SLAVERY.
And we are quite sure this can be done, if
the non-slaveholders will only unite their exer
tions, on the basis of constitutional and uncom
promising opposition to slavery. A brief view
of what we could do will show how infallibly cer
tain it is, that the principles and policy of the
Liberty party, if persevered in, will destroy
slavery from the whole country, without en
croaching upon the rights of a single individu
al, or offering the least violence to the constitu
tion. In the first place, there would be the abolition
of slavery and the slave tiade in the District of
Columbia. Slaves are now held and bought aud
sold in that District, solely by authority of the
Act of Congress, extending the laws of Mary
land over the District. Had Congress incorpo
rated in that act a single 'clause, to the effect of
""excepting all such laws as are supposed to au
thorise the holding mankind as slaves,"" slavery
would have ceased the moment the District pass
ed under the authority of the Federal Govern
ment An act repealing so much of the laws
of Maryland as may authorise slavery, would
free every slave in the District; and the same
laws which now prevent kidnapping in Massa
chusetts, would consign to the penitentiary eve
ry man who should attempt lo re-enslave the
freed people. So general is the belief that this
ought to be done, that nothing but the political
control of the slaveholders has prevented it from
being done long since. It is highly probable
that other parties will eagerly forestall the Liber
ty party in doing this deed of justice, as soon
as this party gives those decided proofs cf spee
dy growth and certain triumph, which leave no
room for uncertainty. The Anti-Corn-Law
League in England, which was - the exact coun
terpart of the Linerly party, so far as the differ
ent constitutions and usages of the two coun
tries would allow, lias carried all its objects, and
Dissolved by its own limitation, before it had
elected twenty members of parliament. Our
object is larger, more amplicated, and less di
rectly in the power of Congress, but we may
hope that so far as the District of Columbia is
concerned, it will be done by others by the time
we shall have carried half a dozen States. Mr.
Calhoun assures us that the District is THE
KEY OF SLAVERY. And when we have
gained this Gibraltor, we shall need no prophet
to promise us the w hole Ian:!.
The exclusion of slaveholders from office, is
our next potent weapon. The slaveholder is
guilty of a high crime, and all such ought to be
excluded from the honors of office. This crime
is peculiarly anti-republican, and its effects upon
our country is most disatrous, making every
man who upholds it worthy to be considered a
public enemy. It is suicidal, therefore, for us
to trust and honor slaveholders. Now consider
how devoted the slaveholders are to politics, how
dependent large sections of the South are upon
the public crib, and how diligently the slave
party avails itself of political power, and we
see that this one principle strikes out the main
pillar of the whole system, and slavery must fall.
Let us have anti-slavery men in every post-office
and custom-house and land office, throughout the
South. Let them understand that they can have
no mail, which is not superintended by a non
sleveholder. Let it be known that no man can
be retained in any office, high or low, who holds
slaves. Let the people of the United Slates de
clare by their votes, that no slaveholder can
ever hope to be president or vice president of the
United States, or judge, or embassador, or sec
retary, or commissioner, or even a clerk in the
Depaitinenis, who has not foresworn slavery,
and the politicians of Kentucky aud Virginia,
and even of South Carolina and Mississippi, will
haste to qualify themselves for public honor, by
not only freeing their own slaves, but by exerting
themselves to rid their States of the evil. How
soon if the people of the North were in earnest,
would Delaware and Maryland and Missouri, be
added to the list of free States. The whole sys
tem would be driven from the country in less
time than any of us dare to mingui&ias
Dancing. The churches are making dancing a sub
ject of discipline, declaring it to be intolerably immor
al. How dare Uiey do it? Is'nt dancing as much a
Bible institution as slavery? Didn't David dance?
Does the New Testament forbid it?

Call it not presumption to address you. Let
us move, in the solid column, upon the ranks of
slavery. Let us lock our arms, by the power of
united political action. Let every man's name
be enrolled, who has fired the bullet of his Bal
lot against Slavery. Let every name be regis
tered, by the middle of September. Sixty-five
thousand men were found, on the ides of No
vember, 1844, inscribed mi the muster-roll of
Human Freedom. You are the moral army of
Liberation. It is not an enlistment for one year,
but during the war. This army, wiih its addi
tions, fight for glory in its most exalted sense.
To deliver three millions of slaves to self-own
ership, and give them the right to do every thing,
which is not wrong, arc the past-words of the
army of deliverance. The army of Liberation
will remove the fetters from mind nud body of
enslaver mid enslaved of fifteen States, double
the agricultural and treble I lie manufacturing
and mechanical products. Another part of
their mission is, to establish 3(5, 000 Common
Schools, those nurseries of truth and knowl
edge, the elements of self-government, in those
15 Slates. This army of liberation will carry
500 printing presses, and one million of Bibles,
and 20,000 school-masters and mistresses, as
frre-will offering, in the day of a most glorious
emancipation, to these States. This army is
charged with the high duty of blotting out Ma
son & Dixon's line, the line of eternal discord.
This army is to collect the bowie-knives, and
revolving, hair-triggered pistols of these States,
and place them in the bottom of the fathomless
sea. This army is to make label honorable, in
these 15 States. This army is to remove all
northern jealousies, and unite North and South,
East and West, in eternal bonds of fraternity.
This nrniy is charged with the modification of
Southern and Northern opinions, as to the con
stitutional powers! of the Federal Government,
on the subject of Tariffs for revenue or Tariffs
for protection, or Free Trade and direct taxation,
believing the extremes, left and right, will see
eye to eye, and walk hand in hand, when a com
mon imerest controls, and common instrumental
ities are employed, to obtain subsistence. This
army is also charged with the purification and
exaltation of American character, by creating a
bond of union between the abstractions of hu
man freedom and the living practicalities by
bridging that hitherto yawning gulf; and this
army is charged with the utter extirpation of
that desolating hypocrisy, which so long in
Church and State, destroyed the use of language,
in suffering a holy abstraction, in religion or
politics standing as our creed, to be a license
practically, to act out all manner of abomina
tions; the purity of the creed making atonement
for the profligacy of the conduct under it.
This army of freedom is charged with rescuing
the character of this great nation from the burn
ing sneers and unanswerable arctocisms of old
Europe, who declared that as hope for man as
cended high, reality dugdungeeiis deep and low,
in which to hide our shame.
This army is charged with the faithful exe
cution of the Declaration of Independence ; the
gnat unperformed, the gnaty admired, but un
available. For seventy years the tuition has
been so overwhelmed, with the truthfulness and
grandeur of its conception, that they have been
content to stand nil of this time and shout their
admiration, before an astonished world, and an
nually arrest the very wheels of human affairs,
while on the 4th of July, we stretched the ut
most power of human genius for the strongest
conceptions of in'ellect, and for the most con
suming thoughts, to be delivered in the most
beautiful robes of language, to stamp that im
pression of veneration on the mind of others, ns.
deeply, as it had sunk in our own. We stand
looking at this splendid ship of State, yet on the
stocks, her masts raised, yards trimmed, canvass
spread, and ballast in, and provisioned for a cir
cumnavigation of the whole circle of human ne
cessities, with orders to call at every port, island
and country in her course; carrying justice,
law, equal rights, to- all men, furnishing them
with a remedy for the wrongs inflicted lor ages,
possessing the sure and certain power of strik
ing fetters and bonds from the legs and arms of
men, with the power of opening prison doors and
the placing the victims on the great platform of
equal and eternal rights, and giving them power
to make the laws they are required to honor, and
in future, the obligations they are bound to
obey.
The Liberty party is charged with the high
duty of launching and navigating the old ship
of American Independence, which has stood for
a launch from the 4th of July, 17(3, while the
seas have swarmed with pirates, and buccaniers,
who have even come upon her deck and sworn
by her stripes and colors, that she never shall be
launched, as long as wood grows and water runs.
These pirates and freebooters have sucked the
free blood of the nation from its veins, and now
threaten the lives of those who may endeavor to
launch this ship, and declare that she was never
made to go to sea ; she was only made to stand
eternally on the stocks as an object of unex-
plainable admiration, as an abstract ship, to be
deified on the stocks, on the fourth of July, and
point the orations of Juniors and Sophomores, at a
College commencement ; and in fact they say, if
you do launch her, they will bore holes in bet
bottom, and siuk her and all her glorious freight,
as she was meant to be a ship only on land and
not on the water ; and these pirates are ready to
prove, that one of the old ship carpenters w ho
built her at Philadelphia, was heard by one of
the pirates to snyy that the ship was not made to
go on the water, but' was intended solely for the
land. And many say, who are not pirates, that
we must search for ihe intention of the old
ship-builders and hands who framed and made
this ship ; if some of them did say that it was
their intention that this ship should sail on the
land, then we, their posterity, are bound to sail
on the land, though the ship itself would con
tradict it, even if every builder should swear the
was to sail on the land !

THE PRESIDENCY IN 1800.
A new President of the United States is to
bb chosen next year. We say a new one, because
not more than half a dozen persons, including
the Hon. James Buchauau, have any
idea of re-electing that eminent functionary.
Mr. Franklin Pierce is a possible candidate;
ao is Caleb Cusliing; so are five hundred or
five thousand others; James Buchanan is an
impossible one. We are to have a new President,
aud very probably aew candidates on all
hands.
\ This paper is pretty well understood to favor
sueh^uitu*! and the 6uTriwdN#of*
soch a spirit, on the part of the Republicans,
as will secure, if (sissible, a uuion of the Opposition
in the contest before us. We do not
deem it necessary agaiu to ""contradict the rumors
from time to time set alloat, that we are
laboring to nominate and elect A, B, or C. The
single end we keep in view is the triumph of
OUr principles. auu mc tvuau.jucui ou?am;crnent
of our country's prosperity and honor.
The elevation of A or B to the Presidency
may seem to us desirable, but the triumph of
our cause is of infinitely greater importance.
Men are at best but means to an end ; and that
end is not their own induction into the Presidential
chair.
Jn the la^t Presidential contest, the votes of
the American people were divided as follows :
Buchanan. 1,838,232; Fecuiont, 1,341,514;
Fillmore, 874,707; Fretnoat and Fillmore together
over Buchanan, 377
Of coarse, it is plain that a substantial,
fraeticui union < )' the- electors who supported
remont and Fillmore, reflectively, insures a
triumph in 1<M>0, even though there should be
Home scaling off ou either side, as there probablv
would be. We can afford to lose one hundred
thousand of the Opposition vote in 1M56,
and still carry the uext President by a handsome
majority.
Is there, then, any iusuperable obstacle to a
substantial union of the Opposition iu 1860?
in other words?What do the Republicans insist
on as essential, that the other branch of
the Opposition uaunot concede to thein ?
Doubtless, there are Republicans whose
opinions and feelings with regard to Slavery i re
such as are not acceptable to conservative
Whigs. We, for instance, regard the continuance
of Human Slavery as at ooce a great crime
and a great blunder ? as the main inciting
cause of our country's misfortunes and perils.
We do inost earnestly believe that Virginia,
for example, would have had double the popu
lation and treble the wealth she now has, had
her soil never been pressed by the foot of a
slave. So >>! North ( arolina, Kentucky, Ten
nessee; ?o, emphatically, of Maryland, Missouri,
Texas. But even we have no idea that the
Federal (Government ever will or should undertake
to intermeddle with the existence of Slavery
in any State of this Union. We ask that
Government simply to let Slavery in tlie States
alone, protecting the inviolability of its mails
and that personal liberty which the Federal
Constitution guaranties to every citizen, leaving
the overthrow of Slavery to the natural
growth and diffusion of intelligence, humanity,
and religion. That the Federal Government
should cease to lie the active champion and
pr?p^Ui<li?t of Slavery, whether in its domesm
tic or its foreign policy, we do urge and insist.
Beyond that point we do not ask nor expect it
to ?0.
The annexation of Texas, under the circumstances
and conditions of that annexation, the
overthrow of the Missouri compact, the whole
course of Federal proceedings in Kansas, from
the hour that Border Ruffians were first permitted
to harass and abuse her Free-State settlers
without resistance or rebuke from those
appointed and paid to administer the laws there,
tlown to the culmination of the Lecomptou
fraud, we hold to be gross departures from that
attitude which it was the duty of the Federal
Government to maintain with regard to Freedom
aiwl Slavery. So with the monstrous project
of paying one hundred millions or over for
the Island of Cuba, for the single purpose of
constituting a new buttress and support of the
slave power in our l'nion. Surely it cannot be
necessary that one should be a deadly foe of
Slavery, in order that he should realize the
gross partiality and injustice of such projects
as this. We do not ask the Federal Government
to nd 11. i.' i - to strengthen the i'reelabor
nterest in our l'nion. We protest
against spending millions lor an opposite purpose.
Who savs that this protest is not justified?
Nor do we ask nor desire the proscription of
slaveholders or Pro-Slavery men by the Federal
Administration. If they insist on proscribing
us, why then they raise an issue which we
must meet, and the hardest fend otf. But we
are quite willing to return to the policy of the
early IYesidents, under whom no man s opinions
re?|?ecting Slavery were made a test of his
fitws? h?r office. N(>u. it ij notorious, no man
is permitted to hold office who is in auv manner
an opponent of Slavery.
What tlie Republican party unitedly demand
and insist on is such a change in the policv of
the Federal Government as will render it no
longer a patron and partisan, but an opponent,
of the future extension of Slavery. We insist
that in future it shall act with regard to Slaverv
extension in the spirit which induced Jefferson
to di vim-, and Washington to sanction, its interdiction
in the Federal Territories, and Gen.
Taylor to favor its exclusion from California.
5So mu'-h, in . -.me. the Republicans must
and will insist on. How mauy of the other
wring of the Opposition will object to it? In
other words, how many of the conservative
Whirs desire that the F?d 1 i invosnmrtnl 1
sha'u continue to bo employed, as it has been
H through the several Democratic Administra
tions since Tyler's apostacv, as an agency for
the propagation and ditl'usion of Human Sia
Terr?
VkVdo i: that than are un thouH
sand gotets in the Union outside of the XationB
al Democratic organization who desire the extension
of Slavery, or that the Federal Governinent
shall favor such extension. In our interH
course with Southern \N higs?and it has not
H been rerv limited?we never met one who did
so. who does not uow call himaeli a Democrat.
If, then, we are not essentially at variance
. on this point, we insist that no insurmountable
B barrier exists to prevent the u fusion "" we deB
sire. We believe that Maryland, Delaware.
B and Missouri, with possibly Kentucky. Tcnn. sB
nee< *n^ North Carolina, may be carried in
B 1860 <br a National ticket which shall be frankB
ly but inoffensively hostile to the extension of
fl Slavery.
B A few words as to men :
B As we desire the opei; and hearty co-operaB
tion of conservative Whips lo help us elect a
B Republican President, should such be notniB
nated, we do not begin by notifying those Whips
B that we will not support nor vote for on. of
B their number, should one be put forward as the
B Opposition candidate. It seems to us consistB
ent neither with good policy, good manners,
B aor even good faith, to do so. Most certainly,
B should prefer an original Republican?GovB
eruor Sewanl or Governor Chase, for iuslance?
B But 8ball heartily and zealously support oat
B Mie John Bell, Edward Bates, or John M.
B Botts, provided we are well assured that his
B influence, his patronage, his power, if chosen
President, will be used not to extend Slavery,
H' but to confine it within the States that see fit
to uphold it. And when we say this, we ask
those who insist that the Slavery issue is suborH
?iiuat?, and that questions concerning the TarH
iff, Internal Improvements, Ac., ought to pre
dominate, to meet us in the same spirit. You
say, Messrs. Conservatives ! that what the country
eminently needs, is a readjustment of the
Tariff, so as to afford at once adequate Revenue
and incidental Protection to the exposed and
suffering branches of our National Industry.
Very well: do you doubt that Governor Seward,
or Governor Chase, if President, would
commend and approve such a Tariff? Mind,
we are not now urging that a distinctive Republican
should be selected as the Opposition
standard-bearer in 1860 ; we are only showing
.1 . n Li: -L u L- .4

you are bound bv your own principles to sustain
him. If the Republicans are good enough
to vote for a candidate of your ?wn stamp, they
are good enough to be voted for by those of
your way of thinkiug. Why not ?
As to our valiant Republican brethren, who
keep reiterating that they will never support
any but a distinctive, original Republican, and
that the Platform of 1856 must be reaffirmed
rtrbatim in 1860, we simply say, It is not wise
to deal in rash promises, rash threats, nor rash
prophecies. You will doubtless do what is best
in I860, whatever you may think or say now;
and it is not wise to utter hot words which may
return to plague you hereafter. If au original
Republican shall be our candidate in i860, you
will want our Conservatives to forget that you
ever threatened to oppose one of their sort if
nominated ; while, if our nominee should not
be a Republican of '56, you will want to forget
those threats yourselves.
We say, then, to the exelusives on either hand,
Keep cool. Victory is clearly within reach of
the Opposition?a victory over which both Republicans
and Conservatives will have ample
reason to rejoice. Le^ it not be fooled away by
a childish strife about names. When Speech
tends to irritate and distract, unspeakable is
the wisdom of Silence.
THE OBERLIN RESCUE TRIALS.
The trial of the UbA-fih rescuers, at Cleveland,
is producing curious results. While the
trial of Mr. Laugston, the second person arraigned
to answer the charge of aiding the
escape of the slave John, is going on from day
to day before the United States court, there is
a great variety of by-play outside the court-room.
The two Kentucky witnesses for the prosecution
are under arrest for kidnapping, and sundry recent
movements are detailed by the Cleveland
papers. The Plaindcaler, of the 22d April,
says:
""This forenoon, the United States Marshal
took the convict Bushuell out of the custody of
the Sheriff, and holds him in the United States
building, over which the State has surrendered
jurisdiction to the Federal Government.
4' Notice has been served on District Attorney
Belden and Marshal Johnson, to appear before
the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio to-morrow,
and show cause why a writ of habeas corpus
should not issue for the release of Simeon
Uushnell and others. This is responded to by
saying that they recognise no authority in the
State officers over the officers of a Federal
OMfL
u Yesterday, the naps of the sleepers were
disturbed by the appearance of a Deputy Sheriff
of Lorain county, who took his seat within the
bar. and beside Jennings and Mitchell, witnesses
from Kentucky, and informed them he
had a warrant far them to appear be fore the
County Court of Lorain county, to answer a
charye of kidnapping one 1 John' out of Oberlin,
with a new of taking him South. The
Clerk of the Federal court was required to issue
a warrant for the arrest and detention of
said Jennings and Mitchell as witnesses, which
was duly served and returned before the hour
of adjournment, and said Jeunings and Mitchell,
for want of bail, were taken into custody by
the Marshal.""
The Herald says:
"" For a time there was great fear a collision
might occur between officers. The
Deputy Sheriff of Lorain had assistants who
were men of mettle, and the presence of the
late Chief of Police, and a large body of interested
spectators, showed that the Marshal had
provided, beforehand, for any emergency. It
is said he had fifty men in the room, to be
used, if necessary, as special bailiffs. It looked
ominous for a time, and the Kentucky witnesses
were evidently thankful they had no bail to offer,
and could be committed to the keeping of
the Marshal.""
The Morning Leader of Saturday has the fol
lowing iu relation to Mr. uusnnell, the convicted
party:
' Yesterday, Marshal Johnson deniande<l of
the Sheriff the mittimus on which ISushtiell had
been held by him. The Sheriff very properly
retained it for his own safety, as it required an order
of court to take Bushnell from his custody
legally. )The jail-room of Bushnell was guarded
by bailiffs yesterday and last night, though the
Marshal had had the test of every possible assurance
that Mr. Bushnell had no desire to
escape. Mrs. B. is permitted to share his imprisonment,
which she does with a true woman's
devotion to one who is persecuted for no other
crime but obeying the Golden Rule of doing
unto others as ye would that they should do
unto you. Mrs. Peck, Mrs. Fitch, and Mrs.
Plumb, and other noble women of Oberlin, also
cheer the prisoners by their presence. Just at
evening. Marshal Johnson visited Bushnell, and,
trembling with excitement, professed much regret
that the District Attorney would not consent
to his return to the county jail, a boon for
which he claimed to have labored. This was
adding unnecessary insult to iujury.""
In the Supreme Court of Ohio, sitting at
Columbus, on the 21st April, Judge Spaulding,
counsel for the prisoners, made application for
a writ of haljeas corpus in favor of his clients.
In making his application, Mr. Spaulding remarked
that under this proceeding he proposed
to arraign the Congressional enactment 0/ 1850
as an excess of legislative power and an innovation
upon the sovereign prerogatives o f the State,
which alone had power to regulate, by pains
and penalties, the internal police of the Commonwealth.
He insisted that' this tribunal was
the constitutional guardian of the personal liberty
of every citizen of Ohio, and, as such, it
was peculiarly 6t and proper that it should take
cognizance of any infringement of this great
right, whether by the federal court or anv
AtKor nAnrpr
The court enjoined the I"". S. Marshal to appear
on Saturday, April 22, to show cause why
a writ of habeas corpus should not issue. A
copy of this injunction was served upon District
Attorney Belden, at Cleveland, on the 22d.
The Morning Ijtadrr of the 23d says the Attorney
was not a little excited on receiving the
notice, and adds:
"" lie was heard to threaten that the prisoners
should not be taken to Columbus on a writ of
habeas corpus from the Supreme Courtof Ohio,
and that they could not be taken to the cars
save through the cannon's mouth 1 The District
Attorney cooled off enough, however, by
evening, to take the train to Columbus. Marshal
Johnson remained to guard and wait upon
his imprisoned witnesses, the kidnappers Jennings
and Mitchell, and the convicted Bushuell.""
A Cleveland correspondent of the Cincinnati
Gazette, speaking of these trials, says :
"" The opinions and actions of the people, and
many of the students of Oberlin, will not be in
the least changed by the result of the trial of!
their associates at Cleveland. If they are all
found guilty, and made to suffer the penalty of
the law, they will believe themselves persecuted
and made to suffer for righteousness' sake ; and
if they are suffered to go without punishment,
they will consider it as another triumph of
truth over evil. But the principles of Freedom
to all. without regard to color, and equal rights,
will be as firmlv maintained and zealously defended
as they have ever been. And were the
same circumstances to occur again, the number
ot volunteers who would willingly offer themselves
to assist in releasing a slave, and transgressing
the same law, would be rather increased
than diminished. There has not been an
occurrence for a long time in this portion of the
State which hna Vio J a: ? <*

the ' National Democracy' that this same Wellington
Rescue Case will have.''
I hk Pax Hand i.e.?The ^ellsburg (Va.)
lhrnJJ, alluding to the resolution, introduced
by Mr. Penney of this city, and which passed
both branches of the Legislature, directing the
Attorney General to inquire into the territorial
claim of Pennsylvania to the Pan Handle of
Virginia, says that the inquiry will result in
nothing. It expresses, however, its conviction
that it would be better for the people of that
section if they were brought under Pennsylvania
jurisdiction. The Slavery question, it says,
is not worth taking into consideration, it being
merely a formality now, in the Pan Handle,
with which no negro complies longer than suits

legislation on the part of \ irginia.

THURSDAY, MAY 5, 1859.
SHALL THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BE
DISBANDED?
The Question Again Submitted.
Some months ago, the New York Tribune
formally proposed to disband the Republican
Party, and substitute for it a union of all the
opponents of the Administration, without regard
to their opinion in relation to Slavery or
Know Nothingisin, embracing Republicans and
Fillmore men,, slaveholders and Pro-Slavery
men, non-slaveholders and Anti-Slavery men(
arranging them all on the simple ground of
! opposition to Mr. Buchanan and his policy.
Assuming to speak for the Republican Party,
it further proposed to divide the Ticket for
1860, the Republicans designating the candidate
for the Presidency, or Vice Presidency, or
consenting that the other parties to the fusion
should have the first choice.
The Era at once entered its protest against
the whole 'scheme, and ?ith all the energy?it
could commahd insisted upon the duty aud
sound policy of preserving the Republican organization,
maintaining its Principles, conducting
the canvass of 1860 on the Issues involved
in the great controversy between Freedom
and Slavery, and selecting as its candidates
able men, distinctively representing these issues.
The case went to the People, and what was
the verdict? Not a Southern newspaper, not
a Southern authority, accepted the proposition
of the Tribune, but a general cry was raised
that it was inadmissible. The Southern Oppo j
sition would have all, or none. Not a single
Republican press, or politician or convention
of any note, assented to the proposition, but in
I ..ii o.ii .v..
till ijuai icio lb it'll uuurt ntc uinop^i uuaiiuu vi
the friends of Freedom. Was not this enough
to satisfy the Tribune?
What occurred afterwards ? It contented
itself with hinting occasionally at "" fusion,""
but seemed to acquiesce in the clear decision
of the Party. Republicans were bold and uncompromising,
utterly repudiating iu practice
the policy of the Tribune, and so they achieved
an uninterrupted succession of triumphs. The
. victories they won were Republican, not Opposition
victories. They were not intolerant, not
proscriptive, but, constituting the only organized
Party opposed to the Administration,
they defined their own issues, pursued their
own course, leaving Old Whigs, Conservatives,
and Native Americans, to vote with them or
with a profligate, Pro-Slavery Administration,
as their consciences should dictate.
That was the true plan, and its wisdom has
been fully attested by^the result. What the
Party has done in the States, let it repeat in the
Federal contest of 1860, and the country will
witness a similar result.
Is it not marvellous that after the "" fusiou "" j
policy has been so utterly repudiated in all sections,
and by all parties, the Tributie should
again present its disorganizing proposition^
again attempt to persuade the Republican Party
to commit suicide ? Having opened our j
columns for a discussion of the Presidential j
Ouestion. we insert the editnrial nf the TVihtms 1
under that head, so that our readers may see
; clearly how flimsy is the argument in support t
of such a policy.
The proposition virtually contemplates the
transfer of the Republicans to the Old Whig
ground: if carried out generally, the Opposition
would be in substAnce a Whig Party, under
Conservative leadership, controlled by Conser- ;
vative usages. That is, the Slavery Question
would be ignored, evaded, or subordinated, and
such men as Winthrop, Fillmore, Bates, and
Botts, would be restored to power. The country
was favored once with a Whig Party, just
like this, and what did it accomplish for Freedom?
How many words in behalf of Human
Rights did it utter in the Congress of the United
States ? Did it prevent the annexation of Texaa
with Slavery? Did it prevent the war against
Mexico to extend the area of Slavery ? Did it
prevent the passage of the Fugitive Slave Bill,
the abandonment of the Proviso, the repeal of
the Missouri Compromise ? Was it ever able
to save Anti-Slavery men from political proscription
? Did it not, with the hue and cry
of a grand Opposition rally, elect John Tyler,
who committed himself to the Texas annexation
policy? Did not the Whigs of the Senate ratify
unanimously the nomination of John C. Cal- j
houn as Secretary of State, and did not the
Whig Press applaud the apppointment?a man
who rested the whole policy of annexation on
Pro-Slavery grounds, and advocated before the
world the institution of Negro Slavery! Did
not that party, with the same hue and cry for a
grand rally of the Opposition, elect Millard
Fillmore, to whose Whig Cabinet and Administration
we owe the passage of the Fugitive
Blacks Act, and the abandonment of the AntiSlavery
policy of the Ordinance of 1787 ? JJid
not that Party, at Baltimore, in 1852, swear by
the Compromise of 3850, and even Mr. Greeley
vote for the candidate of the Platform, while
spitting upon the Platform itself? Did not the
Whigs of the South, in the struggle of 1854
concerning the Missouri Compromise, desert
their Northern associates, unite with Pro-Slavery
Democrats, and carry the repeal ? Did
they not, together with Conservative Whigs of
the North, as they are called, in 1856, unite
in support of Millard Fillmore, thereby deieating
the Republicans, and electing James Buchanan
?
And now the proposition is coolly made, to
go back to all this*"" wallowing in the mire ! ""
To reconstruct a National Whig Party, with
the same reasonable^ wonderfully efficient policy,
which marked the career of National Whiggery
from 1840 to 1854!
The Tribune seems willing to do almost anything
for the sake of "" fusion."" It will not insist
on a reaffirmation of the Republican platform,
or the selection of a Republican candidate
for the Presidency; it would cheerfully support
Bell, Bates, or Botts, and ask no more than
""that the Federal Government should cease to
I + !,?-? onln'i* nkftiv* ? J ** ""
uc me o?.ii-c tuomp.uu auu propagandist ol
Slavery, whether in its domestic or foreign
policy.""
In the opinion of the Tribune, then, there is
no fundamental, necessary conflict between Slavery
and Freedom. The Ethiopian may change
his skin, and the leopard his spots, and the
wolf and the lamb love each other like brothers.
It sees not the slightest difficulty in the
way of the harmonious co-operation of those
who hate Slavery, and those who sneer at such
hatred as fanaticism ; of those who believe that
man cannot hold man as property, and those
who boast that the larger portion of all their
wealth consists in that hint? of property!; of
those who assert the right of Congress to prohibit
Slavery in the Territories, and those who
deny it; of those who affirm the right of the
People of a Territory to exclude Slavery, and
those who deny it; of those who insist that the
A.TIONAL ERA: WASE
Territorial Legislature ought to interdict, and
those who insist that it ought to protect it; of
those who contend that the Constitution of the
United States regards slaves always as "" persons,""
and those who maintain that it always
treats them as "" property ;"" of those who declare
that Slavery is against natural right, can
exist only by positive statute, and does not
exist under the Federal Constitution in Federal
Territory, and of those who declare that Slavery
is not against natural right, exists as
a normal institution, does exist under the Federal
Constitution, and is protected under its
guaranties in Federal Territory; of those who
denounce the Fugitive Slave act as barbarous
and unconstitutional, and those who sustain it
as reasonable and constitutional!
Good Heavens! What can we expect of the
masses of the People, when this Tribune, so
truculent in the expression of its Anti-Slavery
opinions, so zealous a propagandist of AntiSlavery
sentiments, can seriously put forth a
proposition, no more reasonable or feasible,
than would be a project for bridging over the
gulf between Heaven and Hell, and placing
the universe under the joint sovereignty of 1
God and Satan ?
"" Nor do we ask nor desire the proscription i
of slaveholders or Pro-Slavery men by the Fed- i
eral Government,"" says the Tribune. ""If they
insist upon proscribing us, why then they
raise an issue which we must meet, and the
hardest feud off? But we are quite willing to
return to the policy of the early Presidents, \
under whom no man's opinions respecting 31^2
very were made a test of his fitu^^Xur
Has the Tribune been asleep ? For the
twenty-five years the battle has been going 6n
between Freedom and Slavery, and throughout
all that period it has been the settled policy of
slaveholders and Pro-Slavery men to exclude
earnest Anti-Slavery men from Federal offices
Of trust and influence ; but the Tribune talks as
if such a policy were something quite novel,
extraordinary, not yet determined upon. "" If
they insist upon proscribing us, why, then,
they raise an issue which we must meet!""
This would be laughable, if the subject were not
so serious. "" If,"" and "" if,"" and "" if""?what
in the name of common sense have they been
doing for a quarter of a century but this very
thing, which the Tribune says, "" must raise an
issue ?""
The charity of the Tribune is as long as its
memory is short. "" Nor do we ask nor desire
me proscription 01 siavenoiaers or rro-siaverv
men by the Federal Adminstration."" What
do you desire then ? Do you expect any Administration,
elected to carry out certain measures,
to choose for its instruments or agents
men, pledged to thwart its policy? If a Tariff
Adminstration exclude Free Trade men from
its Councils, and fill offices of political influence
with agents concurring with its views
on the subject of a Tariff, is that ""proscrip- (
tion ? "" Would not any other course be weak
and silly, or raise the presumption of insincerity
and treachery on the part of the Administration ?
The People are not proscriptive when they ,
vote for men who represent their views on (
great questions at issue, and against men of (
opposite opinions, any more than he is pro- (
scriptive who employs a blacksmith, instead of
a locksmith, to shoe his horse; nor is a President
proscriptive, who, elected by a majority of (
the People to annex Texas or purchase Cuba,
for the purpose specially of strengthening Sla- ]
very, selects his agents with a definite view to
their fitness for promoting that end. ,
The Tribune may speak for itself on this
point; but the Republicans, while they sin- j
cerely disclaim a proscriptive spirit, would be ,
false or foolish, if they did not intend to do
just what the Tribune deprecates?exclude
from offices of trust and influence Pro-Slavery
men. How. otherwise, could they exclude Proslavery
ideas? Do men gather grapes of
thorns, or figs of thistles ? Mr. Bates accepts !
the obiter dicta about Slavery under the Con- |
suiuiiim in lerrnones, as a uecision, nnai and
obligatory upon every Department of the Government:
if President, would he appoint
Judges, and Attorneys, and Marshals, for the
Territories, openly committed to a contrary
opinion ? Mr. Seward denies that these extrajudicial
opinions of the Supreme Bench have
any binding force, and asserts that they are not
good law: if President, would he fill the Federal
offices in the Territories with men openly
committed to them ?
We might run through the whole list of
questions embraced in this great controversy
between Freedom and Slavery, and point out
the utter irreconcilability of the creeds of the
Pro-Slavery and the Auti-Slavery Parties.
The Issues have been raised?the Tests have
been made?the country must have an Anti- I
Slavery or a Pro-Slavery Administration. We
cannot cheat each other?we cannot unmake |
the Tests, suppress the Issues, thrust aside the
Controversy, without settliug it. It is too late.
We cannot go back to the policy of indifferent- j
ism or neutrality, and we would not, if we
could. We have all eaten of the fruit of the
tree of knowledge of Good and Evil: we can- j
not unlearn what we have learned: it now I
only remains that we should choose between
them. If the majority of the American People
be Pro-Slavery, let them elect a Pro-Slavery
Administration ; if a majority be Anti-Slavery,
let them elect an Anti-Slavery Administration. '
How can the Tribune, which has hithertp been
reputed a Republican paper, and supposed to
be the advocate of a positive policy, now devote
its energies to the suppression of this great
Issue, to the exclusion of any decision of this
Paramount Question?
Its one idea is, success; and by success we j
are to understand the overthrow of the present
Administration, without any certain guaranty
in relation to the principles and policy of the
new Administration. For one, we go into no
political contest, without first knowing definitely
for what we are to contend, what paramount
principle or measure is to be the issue. There
must be no guesswork, no trusting to chance,
no quackery. We will not cheat, nor consent
to be cheated. The Republican Party, preserving
its integrity, and ascendant in a ma
jority of the Free States, although not in possession
of the Federal Power, is far more efficient
for the protection of the great interests
of Freedom, and as a safeguard against the
usurpations of Slavery, than it could ever be,
should it succeed in obtaining Federal Power>
by the sacrifice of its integrity, and the surrender
of its principles.
In 1856, the Tribune was in favor of a clear
Republican organization, although Know Nothingism
presented a most formidable front, and
it was quite uncertain to what extent the People
could be rallied under the Republican banner.
The experiment was made. Republicanism
was demonstrated to be dominant in the
hearts of the People of the Free States; the
Pro-Slavery Democracy triumphed over it only
through the diversion made by the Fillmore
Party, which hoped to carry enough States to
throw the election into the House. It carried
one State, and decided the election in favfcr
of Slavery. From that hour, the FillmoCe
Party ceased to exist as an organisation, atd
the Republican Party grew stronger aid
stronger, being confessedly the only Party Capable
of contesting the ground with the Black
Democracy. Joined by disaffected Democrats,
by Whiga, Conservatives, and Know Nothings,
whose eyes had been opened by the respite pf
the struggle of 1856, it obtained the control
1INGT0N, D. G, MAY
even of those States which had given their electoral
votes to Mr. Buchanan. Meantime, his
abominable policy in relation to Lecompton, Cuba,
and Slavery Propagandism generally, distracted
his own Party, alienated many of its
Btancheat supporters, and it became quite evident
that, should the two parties, the Pro-Slavery
Democracy and the Republican, be permitted
to meet each other again, face to face,
on the Presidential battle-field, the result must
be a Republican victory. How could there be
any doubt? Know Nothingism, as a] distinct
political agency, had generally disappeared;
Old Whiga and Conservatives had become Republicans
or Democrats, or retired from active
politics ; the people were fast becoming organized,
as Democrats or Republicans, and there
was no indication of the formation of a third
party strong enough to determine the struggle
between them.
What could have prompted the Tribune at
such a moment to assume that a third party
was in existence, whose prejudices must be
consulted?that the Republican party could not
win success by adherence to its own organization
and policy?that Conservatives, Whigs,
Know Nothings, Slaveholders, and Pro-Slavery
men, must be conciliated, and Republicans must
forego, if necessary, their own organization, their
principles, their men, for the sake of uniting
with those discordant classes, and forming a
great Opposition, weak enough to forswear all
Principle, strong enough to poll a majority of
the votes of the country ?
have said enough to show the utter reHJmnce^f
i^ich a policy to sound principle:
Jne remark more, and we shall dismiss the subject
for the present. The scheme of the Tribune
is impracticable. Such a combination as
it recommends can never be formed. The Black
Democracy is still strong throughout the free
States. See it casting only two thousand fewer
votes than the Republicans in enlightened Connecticut!
In nearly all the Free States, it is
the adhesion of the earnest Anti-Slavery men to '
Republican Party that turns the scale against the
its antagonist. A partial disaffection of this
element would reverse the state of things.
Let the politicians beware how they trifle with
the conscfences of men who care for 110 success
but that of the Right. On both sides of the
great Question are large bodies of men, entertaining
decided convictions, who detest trickery
and compromise. Let such such an
Opposition be formed, as the Tribune vainly
counsels, and let Rates, Botts, or Bell, be the
nominee, the stigma of abolition attached to
the ticket would drive every Pro-Slavery man
in the South into the ranks of the Slave Democracy,
and thus alienate every Southern
State, while the taint of Pro-Slavery would disgust
and drive off every Anti-Slavery man in
the Free States, thereby restoring the Democracy
in them to power. On the other hand, let
Chase, Seward, or Banks, be the candidate, and
pass what resolutions you please, ignore, evade,
or mystify real issues as you may, does any
man in his senses believe that a single Southern
State could be carried? And does not
every man in his senses see that a policy so
disingenuous would inevitably hazard the success
of the ticket in the Free States?
Let us be honest, manly, consistent.
We shall be pleased to have the co-operation
of the Conservatives and Old Wbigs, whom the
Tribune is so concerned for, but if, when the
lines are drawn between a Slavery-Propagating
Democracy and a Slavery-Restricting Republican
Party, they prefer the success of the former,
then we know they would be satisfied with
nothing short of the total surrender of Republican
Principles, the disorganization of the Republican
Party, and the adoption of the same
policy in relation to Slavery, that has given it
its present mastery in the country. If, 011 the
contrary, they are sincere in their desire to see
the Black Democracy overthrown, let them
unite with the only Party, whose moral power
and numerical force are sufficient for the
achievement of that end ; and let the Tribune
reconsider its ground, and ponder well the
question, whether its counsels are not calculated
to raise expectations among Conservatives
and Old Whigs that must come to naught, and
to sow dissension and distrust among Republicans,
unfavorable to united and decided action.
THE WAR PROSPECT IN EUROPE.
The long-promised Ministerial statements of
the progress and actual state of negotiations
upon the Italian question were made in the
British House of Lords by the Earls of Malmesbury
and Derby, and in the House of Commons
by Mr. Disraeli, on the 18th ult.
"" From these revelations, it appears that the
informal intermediation attempted by the English
Government, through the visits of Lord
Cowley to Paris and Vienna, had reached an
encouraging stage when the proposition of a
general Congress, emanating from Russia, was
received. Abandoning its individual efforts,
the British Cabinet at once devoted itselt to advance
the Russian project, but early encountered
a serious difficulty in the refusal of Austria
to treat unless Sardinia disarmed. Subsequently,
thi3 difficulty was obviated bv a suggestion
that the three quasi belligerent Powers
should disarm previous to the meeting of the
Congress. Austria acceded to this plan, but
Sardinia declined, and the Emperor of the
French would only comply with an important
modification?namely, that if Sardinia disarmed,
she should be admitted to a seat in the
Congress, and that the disarmament should not
precede the deliberations of the Congress, but
should constitute their initial topic. As there
was no hope of Austria or England acquiescing
in these requirements, the ultimate possibility
of a pacific settlement seemed, at the departure
of the steamer, to have entirely vanished. Indeed,
in all well-informed circles, it was understood
that the object of the counter proposition
of France was merely to gain time for the completion
of her military preparations.''
The Earl of Derby made an able speech, in
the course of which he said :
u The time is nearly come when England?
which has, indeed, made one more effort, suggested
one more proposition, which I am not
at liberty to lay before your Lordships?shall
say that the period has gone by for trifling, and
that, having exhausted all her powers of persuasion,
and left no stone unturned to effect a
settlement upon principles which have received
the unanimous approval of her Parliament, she
must, however reluctantly, withdraw from interference
in affairs in which she can no longer
hope her interference would be useful to the public
interests or consistent with her own dignity,
and must again reserve to herself, as she has
done up to the present moment, absolute and
entire freedom to take such steps as she may
hereafter think fit. [Cheers.]
"" My noble friend has already pointed out the
lamentable consequences which must arise, If
war does break out, to Italy herself, whatever
be the ultimate result, or whoever be in the first
instance successful. I think my noble friend
underrates the magnitude of the danger, if he
supposes that the war will be confined to Italy.
It will be a war, in the first place, of the most
sanguinary description, because a war of principle
and of passion. It will not be a war between
two great nations contending for some
definite object, but a war exciting the most violent
passions ; and once begun in Italy, it will
extend far beyond the limits of that country.
Other passions will be roused, other interests
will be touched, other nations will be called to
interfere, and the war originating in Italy will
certainly at no distant period extend far and
wide, wrapping the whole of Europe in one
general conflagration.""
Mr. Gladstone condemned in strong language
those passages of Mr. Disraeli's speech in which
he seemed to imply that if England took a part
in the probable war, it would be on the side of
Austria. The English people cannot be dragged
into the support of Austrian absolutism.
5, 1859.
THE FOUR PRINCIPAL PHASES OF
' DEMOCRACY.""
The perpetual unrest of the "" Democracy ""
in search of a platform, tirm and durable, if
viewed from a picturesque point of view, has
something in it truly touching. It reminds one
of the stories which travellers through the
deserts of Arabia relate, of that tautalizing apparition
known as the mirage, which perpetually
holds the word of promise to the famished
lips of the wayfarer, but breaks it to the hope.
There seems to be no resting place for the soles
of their feet. The deluge has come upon them,
but no ark of safety presents itself, to give assurance
that even a remnant is to be saved.
No bow of hoDe sunns the heavens, in token of
coming rest and sunshine. Down, down, they
go, still wrangling and fighting for the spoils,
and agreeing in nothing.
For many years, the sham Democracy, in
common with their opponents, the Whigs, stood
firmly by the Missouri compromise. But in an
evil hour, Mr. Douglas, of Illinois, instigated by
the demon of ambition, moved its repeal, that
the Territories now known as Kansas and Nebraska
might become slaveholding. In order
to reconcile the Northern people to this measure,
Mr. Douglas laid it down as an indisputable
axiom in politics, that the people of the
Territories have the same right to regulate their
domestic affairs that the people of the States
possess, fie claimed for them absolute independence
in the formation of their local laws
and institutions, independent of the Federal
Government. Said he, we concede to them by
Eneral consent the right to legislate upon the
relations u of parent and child, of guardian and
ward, of master and apprentice;"" then why not
concede the same right of legislation in regard
to negroes? Are negroes so much better than
everybody else, that their rights require the peculiar
protection of the Federal Government? This
demagoguism, shallow and heartless as it was,
was not without its weight, and the bulk of the
Northern Democracy followed their leaders in
pursuit of the phantoms, "" popular sovereignty ""
and "" non-intervention.'' The Slavery propagandists
of the South, thinking that the great
obstacle to the admission of Slavery into the
Northwest Territories was removed, were in
ecstacies, and shouted for joy. President Pierce
hesitated, but at length was swept alontr in the
"" Democratic "" current, the great majority of
the Southern Whigs grounded arms, and joiued
the chorus of non-intervention ; and all hands
concurred in proclaiming the final overthrow of
Abolitionism.
But the people took the Federal Government
at its word, and organized emigration companies
for the settlement of Kansas. The border
ruffians of Missouri, aided by the Central Government,
attempted to beat the people back,
and seize Kansas as a slaveholding possession*
They were foiled,\ and the people triumphed.
The propagandists saw their error in admitting
the doctrine of"" popular sovereignty.""' They repudiated
the dangerous heresy, and insisted
that neither Congress nor the Territorial Legislatures
can exclude Slavery. Upon this issue
they staked the Union, as usual. The Federal
Government immediately adopted it, and, by its
iuiluence over the Supreme Court, a decision
or opinion of the Court was promulgated,
simultaneously with the present President's inaugural
address, declaring this to be the true
interpretation of the Constitution.
HprP. tliPli. HMP wnnltl Intro annnAco/1 tlm
Democracy had found a resting place, a "" finality.""
But not so. For, however congenial to
Southern minds the idea that neither Congress
nor the people of a Territory can exclude Slavery,
it was found to be utterly impossible to
keep the Northern allies to their allegiance
upon such a basis. Its effect was to drive the
jrank and file into ^he Republican party. Mr.
Douglas, notwithstanding his overweening confidence
in himself, at length saw that this must
be the result, and hastened to make an issue
with his former friends, by opposing the policy
of forcing Slavery into Kansas under the
fraudulent Lecoinpton Constitution. Gradually,
as his prospects.for the Senate became clouded
over, he grew bolder, and at length uttered
his Freeport speech, in which, while acknowledging
the authority of the Dred Scott decision, ]
he insisted that practically the people of a Ter- i
ritory may exclude Slavery by "" unfriendly
legislation.""
This was bold language for a man who has
ever acknowleged his allegiance to the slave interest,
and at one time it threatened to be his
final undoing. But Mr. Douglas has done
much to counterpoise the effect of this heretical
utterance, by the alacrity with which he has
supported the President's thirty million corruption
fund for the purchase of Cuba, his advocacy
of the policy of taking military possession
of Mexico and Central America, and the pains
taken by his organ in this city to show that, in
point of fact, popular sovereignty is an empty
sound, signitying nounng.
But the South, led on by Henry A. Wise, of
Virginia, took the alarm at the idea of "" unfriendly
legislation,"" and now goes a stride be""
yond anything heretofore demanded, by insisting
that Slavery must be protected in the Territories.
The Administration, hoping to find a happy
medium between these extremes, lays down,
through its new organ, the Constitution, a third
platform, in the following words :
"" There is 110 longer any intestine dissension
of the least importance in the Democratic party
on the Slavery question. The principles emblazoned
on the banner are, non-intervention,
by Congress or by Territorial Legislatures,
either to establish or prohibit Slavery within the
Territories, and the protection of slave property
therein, as long as the Territorial condition
shall remain, by the Judiciary, under the Constitution
of the United Slates.""
The Douglas organ, the States, takes fire at
this new platform of Mr. Buchanan, and denounces
it as utterly fatal to Southern interests.
W? confess that we felt curious, as we took up
the article of the States, to know where its
editor would join issue with the Constitution.
In our simplicity, we imagined that the ramparts
thrown around the institution of Slavery
by the President's organ were sufficiently strong;
but the Douglas organ, with its habitual con""
cern for Slavery, detects a perilous gap in the
wall, through which the Free-Soil hosts may
march with flags flying and drums beating.
TKo u'Pfil* nnint its nrpaont^tl 111 thp linlnrkv
^ f J
word "" establish."" The idea that the people
of the Territories cannot establish Slavery i? to
the Douglas organ mopstrous. That paper is
clear on the point that they cannot prohibit
Slavery, because such legislation would contravene
the Dred Scott decision ; and, in the name
of all that is reasonable, what can popular sovereignty
signify, if it is not the right to establish
and protect Slavery ? We confess that we cannot
see.
But there still remains another wing of the
Democracy to be noticed, which, by the common
consent of all the others, has been pronounced
hopelessly heretical. We allude to the
Pennsylvania or Forney wing. The schismatics
of Pennsylvania not only iusist upon
popular sovereignty in the Territories in the
broadest sense of the term, and, if we mistake
not, nncontrolled by Supreme Court decisions,
but they avow themselves opposed to the admission
of Slavery into the Territories. They
also denouqge the idea of reviving the slave
trade in unmeasured terms ; and, in general,
their sentiments upon the subject of Slavery
are more in conformity with those of the Re
= ?
publican party, than with the sham Democracy.
Here, then, are four Democratic platforms,
all claiming to be the true and regular one, and
each differing front the other.
1. There is the President's platform, as announced
in his organ, the Conxfitution, which
declares that neither Congress nor the Territorial
Legislatures have any right to establish
or prohibit Slavery. It is silent as to the re- ,
vival of the African slave trade.
2. The Wise or true Southern platform,
which insists that it is the duty of Congress to
pass laws for the protection of Slavery in the
Territories, and to abolish the laws which prohibit
and punish the African slave trade.
3. The Douglas platform, which insists that ,
the Territorial Legislatures may adopt "" un- ,
friendly legislation "" against Slavery, but which
he at the same time admits to be unconstitu- ,
tioual, and therefore void. His centra/ organ
interprets the doctrine of Mr. Douglas to mean (
that the Territorial Legislatures may exercise ,
their popular sovereignty by establishing and
upholding Slavery; while any "" unfriendly ]
legislation "" will be treated as a nullity by the
Federal courts. The same organ insists that ^
the South has a right to demand the repeal of ,
the laws against the slave trade.
4. The Hiekman-Forney platform, which (
insists on popular sovereignty absolutely, and i
favors the exclusion of Slavery from the Territories.
It also insists on a rigid enforcement |
of the laws which punish the slave trade as 1 :
piracy. I
Each of these factions denounces all the i
others with extreme bitterness. The IlickmauForney
faction occupies the untenable position
of affecting to claim Mr. Douglas as its leader, ,
when, in fact, he has more sympathy with the t
most ultra Southern wing, represented by Wise
Davis, and Brown, than w ith the Free-Soil schismatics
of Pennsylvania. The latter cannot
support Douglas without a flagrant apostacv j
from the principles laid down at their recent
State Convention, while the other three wings 1
of the Democracy might with perfect consisten- ' '
cy unite in support of the Illinois Senator.
Since writing the above, we perceive, by the 1
Washington correspondent of the New York
Herald, that negotiations are on foot between
the different factions of the Democracy "" for j
a reunion on the basis of the President's plat- ]
form as above given ; that is to say, entire ab- |
stinence from Congressional and Territorial 1
legislation for or against Slavery, but with the '
ample protection iA the institution furnished by J
tllP Spfitt flftpia'win ami tVw> fntiiro actinn
of the court in accordance therewith. It is j
said by the J It raid's correspondent that Mr. '
Douglas has assented to this arrangement; but
whether Mr. Wise and the Southern ultras agree J
to it. is not stated. We presume that thus far (
the arrangement only includes the Administration
and Douglas. The writer says that Forney
holds out against it, but that he will either have '
to come in, or go over to the Republicans.
These diplomats, we predict, will still have
serious work to perform, before they restore <
harmony to the ranks. They may induce the <
Southern fire-easters to yield the point in regard
to the protection of Slavery in the Territories
by Congressional legislation, as that is at ]
best an impracticable humbug; but what will
they do with the slave trade ? Will they agree
to let the laws against it sleep ? We intend 1
strictly to observe the tone of the allied organs
of the Black Democracy in this respect. The as- 1
surance has been given by Douglas, that he will
not sustain the people of the Territories in enacting
"" unfriendly legislation "" against Slavery:
while the Administration pledges Federal sup- ;
port, including that of the Supreme Court, to i
the institution ; and we shall not be surprised
if private assurances are given that no serious i
etforts will ha made enforce the laws for the !
suppression of the slave trade.
Such nre the known and probable terms of
coalition between the corrupt and spoils-seeking 1
factions of the Slave Democracy. It would be j
difficult to imagine a basis of union more thoroughly
Pro-Slavery. Conscious that the majority
of the people who are likely to occupv the
Territories in future will be aversa to Slavery,
this platform proposes to strip them entirely of
i i f i . rti I
legislative Junctions in regard to Slavery, that ;
subject being entirely too high fur popular sovereigns
to dispose of. If tliis statement of the
Herald turns out to be correct, it will finally
dispose of Mr. Douglas's popular-sovereignty
hobby; or, at any, rate, deprive him of the ben- (
efit of it. He will simply drop down to the level
of other Northern instruments of the Slave '
Power, and be as impotent for evil as he is dis- '
inclined to good.
MR. FRENCH'S REMARKS AT THE JEF- |
PERSON BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION. ]
After a fine piece of music from the band,
Mr. Blair introduced Major Benjamin B. French '
as the person selected to read the Declaration 1
of Independence. '
Mr. French prefaced the reading of that (
cherished paper with the following remarks :
My Friends and Fellow Citizens :
About eighty-three years ago, the hand of j
the man the anniversary of whose birth we ,
meet here this evening to celebrate, was engaged
in writing one of the most remarkable
papers which ever emanated from mortal brain. 1
It was the great charter of our Liberties?our <
Declaration of Independence ! ;
On the fourth of July, 177?i, that glorious
Declaration was unanimously adopted by the 1
Congress of the United Colonies, and this Na- 8
tion assumed its rank among the Nations of ""J
the earth as "" the United States of America."" r
On that day, or immediately subsequent (
thereto, that Declaration received the signatures
of fifty-six men?brave, determined, resolute? v
men who had declared their rights, and. at all 1
hazards, were determined to maintain them? r
men whom we may well be proud to call our j
political fathers, and whose like we ne'er shall ^
i... .1: nrvrrn otroin "" j
That Declaration emanated from the hrain c
and came from the pen of Thomas Jefferson, v
well and truly designated as *'the great Apostle <j
of Liberty,"" whose republican principles we t
adopt, whose memory we revere, and the anniversary
of whose birth we have met here to commemorate.
N
Most appropriate and most proper, then, it is
that we should listen to that Declaration ; and
the welcome doty of reading it has been as- (
signed to me, which I shall now proceed to perform.
i
Mr. French then, iu a clear and audible voice, (
and with much emphasis, read the Declaration
of Independence. (Mr. French's remarks and ,
the reading were received with applause.)
A Fiexp ix Human Shapk.?The master ;
ol a vessel from iiath, Maine, has been arretted
at San h ranciseo, in consequence of the inhu- t
man treatment of his crew. Two men were 1
found on board, whose condition is in the last '
degree wretched. The Bulletin says:
"" The (logging was of the most brutal description
possible to conceive ; for the naked backs
and sides of the men were not only completely t
cut up with lashes, but salt brine was thrown b
upon the wounds, and allowed to dry on ; and (
this operation was repeated a number of times, j
To add to the horror, the men were ironed to
the floor of the hold, and barely sufficient food *given
them to support the almost extinct spark fi
of life. The present appearance of the men, <j
with their backs striped black and blue, and in ^
many places cut through to the bones, their
shrunken arms and sunken eyes, and general 8
cadaverous and ghostly-looking faces, is frightfuL""
There was on board the vessel a man who c
had been reduced to lunacy by the same system c
of brutality; and the crew testified that another P
man had been killed and thrown overboard, ft

KENTUCKY POLITICS.
The politicians of Kentucky of both part , s
are playing a most unprincipled game tor t!.(
spoils. The sham Democracy, for the sah.- .if
keeping or making terms with the anti-Leeoinu
ton Northern u Democracy,"" has ventured to
take the position that Congress should not interveue
to prevent the Territories from excluding
Slavery by "" unfriendly legislation."" This
position falls short in liberality of that heretofore
occupied bv the ""Americans"" and Whi^.
But the latter, with unparalleled prostitution,
have seized the opportunity to outbid the I).
mocracy for the support of the slave interest.
The American or Whig candidate. Bell, take,
the ground that it is the duty of i t()
protect Slavery in the Territori.-.; and the
Louisville Journal, the old organ of 11. nn
Plav. and defender of his A nti
jion views, comes up squarely and eiitliusia-ti
ally to the support of this ultra Southern d?'11
and.
From the report of ? debate between Me<*rs.
Bell and Magotfiu, the candidates of the Whig-,
ind Democrats for the Governorship, which to< k
place at Lebanon, Ky., we quote as follows froru
:he Louisville Journal:
"" As for myself. said Mr. Bell, 1 have no concealments
to make. By virtue of the Constitu:ion
of the United States. Slavery goes into the
Territories as soon as a Territorial Government
s organized : and as soon as it is organized, the
Constitution tlings its protecting wing arour.d
t. The power of Congress under the Coustitnion
is ample to protect and not to impair any
ight. Slave property stands on the same foot
ng as all ut^ier personal property, and, as :i
Northern man has a right to be protected in
iny species of property, so a Southern man has
inder the Constitution the fullest guarantee fur
he full protection of his slave property in the
Territories. He then would ask Mr. Magotlin
1st. Has Congress the constitutional power
;o protect Slavery in the Territories?
2d. Ought Congress to interfere to protect
southern property in slaves in the Territorh '
Mr. Bell answered both these questions fully
ind fairly in the aflirmativa, and asserted that
t was the bounden duty of Congress to protect
tot only against any actual prohibition hut
urainst any ' unfriendlv legislation ' on rt... ......
jf a Territorial Legislature.'""
The same report continues:
""Mr. Magoffin, in his halt-hour replv, t. 1.
lie ground that Congress has the power to pa--,
laws to protect Slavery in the Territories but
it"" the Territorial Legislature refuse to pas- pr
tective laws or legislate unfriendly to Slav.rv,
lie was 011 the ground, broad and square,.,!
Congressional non-intervention. We had the
Supreme Court of the I'nited States to ij t .-al
:o, and that was the last resort.""
The Louisville Journal referring to this d.!>ate
in a leading editorial, says:
"" Makoffix in' Favor of Svuattfr Sovkreiontt?The
Issue Fairi.v Made l*r.?It will
t>e seen from the fejrort in our paper to-dav of
;he discussion at Lebanon 011 Tuesday, that the
Democratic candidate for the Governor.-hip 111
Kentucky has declared unquivocallv in favui
of squatter sovereignty, whilst the gifted and
irlorious standard-bearer of the Opposition has
declared as unequivocally against it.
"" This settles the issue ; it defines the position
of the Democracy of Kentucky on the point in
question beyond the reach of the protest of disenters
or the subtlety of trimmers. It lix< the
thing. It nails the party fast and firm to
the most odious and indefensible dogma that
has ever disfigured the politics of the country.
Here and there, undoubtedly, a member of the
Democracy will twist and squirm : but the 1ki.Iv
of the party, the party itself, is pinned iuiniov
ably to the hideous and noxious doctrine. The
Democracy of Kentucky is at length not onlv
virtually but formally committed to the vi.e
heresv of suuatter Koveroitrnt v Tim
representative, ihe authoritative exponent ot
the organization has publicly and explictly endorsed
the wretched juggle. DocglasisM, thi:
MOST ACTIVE AMI FATAL SHAPE OF AboLITHIV
ISM, IS OPENLY TRIl'MI'UAXT IX THE i'oc.mtls
OF THE PARTY.""
In another articl. the Journal follows up the
assault ?pon the "" Democracy "" and their candidate
in the following fierce style:
' Who does not turn with an exalting .sen-1
of relief and a glow of pride from this rickety
and slouching heresy, to the fair and nianlv
and statesmanlike position of Joshua F. Bell 1
Rejecting with ineffable scorn, as every candid
man of ordinary sense must do, the Slat sman'j
cherished fallacy that the power to protect implies
""the power to destroy, Mr. Bell assert-,
frankly, at once the power and the duty of Cousrress
to protect (if necessary) the right- of the
South in the Territories of the Union. 'On ?
the new question of protection to Slavery in
the Territories,"" says the Democratic authority
from which we have already quoted, ' Mr. Ml
assumed a bold and decided position. He was
in favor of the protection of slave property by
Congressional legislation, in the event of the
Territorial Legislature's failing to pass protective
laws.' How nobly does this position
contrast with the cowardly and faithless dodge
jf non-intervention, as now interpreted by the
Democracy of the State, whether resting on
denial of the power of Congress to intervene, or
an the alleged impolicy of exerting the power!
It is as light com oared with darkness.""
We confess our surprise at finding Mr. Cr;'
enden ardently engaged in supporting this
lltra Pro Slavery sectional ticket. From the
editorial columns of the Journal we again
juote as follows :
"" Hon. John J. Crittenden was present at an
Opposition meeting in Franklin county last
week, which appointed Congressional conferees,
and addressed those assembled in an
iarnest, forcible, and eloquent speech.""
The idea of a co-operation between honest
Republicans and such an 44 opposition "" as that
)f Kentucky, is utterly preposterous. No genu
ne Republican can have any sympathy with a
lespieable spoils-seeking faction, which ha*
ibased itself in the dust before the slave power.
This same Kentucky 4* opposition "" has, until
ecently, made a great merit of its oppo-oti""""
o the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, by
vhich Slavery was excluded from the greater
>art of our Western Territories. And now,
nerely for the sake of success, it avows itselt
11 favor of legislating Slavery into those Terri
ories. Henry Clay said that no human power
ould induce him to vote for the spread of Sla
cry over a foot of free soil ; and here are his
legenerate followers in Kentucky, proclaiming
heir readiness to legislate the institution into
ill the Territories of the Union, however re
rolting it may be to the inhabitants.
Xox-I.VTKRVEVTioy.?Thoce who are ready
o support the pretensions of Presidential a
lirants who profess to be in favor of non-inter
rention on the part of Congress with Slavery in
he Territories, would do well to scan closely
vhat is meant by the term. Senator Green, of
Missouri, for instance, professes to be a non-iu
erventionist. He said:
"" The doctrine of non-interference by Con
Tress with Slavery in the Territories means,
md can only mean, that Congress should nei
her establish nor prohibit it. That is u'l.
Leave these questions to the Constitution and
o the courts. But whatever rights individuals
lave in the Territory, may demand, and when
lemanded, mi st have adequate protection.""
Senator Green but fore-shadows the interpreation
which would be placed upon the doctrine
iy many of those who are loudest in its praise,
""ofcgress is not to legislate Slavery into the
territories. O nol that is unnecessary. The
Constitution carries the institution into every
x>t of the public domain, and the rights of inlividuals
thus established by virtue of the Contitutiou
may need protection. If needed. Conreea
cannot withhold it!
Massachusetts.?Senator Wilson, of Massahusetts.
has written a strong letter against the
ontirmation by the people of that State of the
opositiou to exclude foreigners from voting
>r two years after their naturalization.

Historical . Facts.
jow Congressional Intervention affects
Slavery trie Jerruortet.
The principal argument .mado usoof
by republican brawlers to deceive the peo-
Ic, and cam tho spons of olhco is, mat
if Congress prohibits Slavery in tho Ter
ritories instead of leaving tho subject to
tho people, tho prohibitory Jaw will liavo
tho effect to exclude slavery from all tho
Territories for nil cqming time, whatever
may bo tho climate, toil, productions, or
wishes of tho pcoplo therein. Tho histo
ry of Congressional prohibition utterly
emohsbed tho argument wo claim mat
the prohibition of Slavery by Congress is
uot only unconstitutional and contrary to
the principles upon which tho' govern
ment wits founded, but .thai, it. ever has
been ignored by the pcoplo of the Terri
tories in every inslanco where it has been
applied, nnd that it has no influonco in
excludiug slavery therefrom.
Is ow for tho tacts :
Tho ordinance known as Jefferson's
Ordinance, was passed uuder tho old Con
federacy, and before tho present Consti
tution of tho Uuitcd estates was adopted.
It extended over tho North-West Jerri-
tory, now comprising tho btatcs of Uhio,
Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin
and Iowa. Tho ordinance declared that
there shall neither be slavery nor invol
untary servitude in tho said .territory,
otherwiso than in punishmeut of ciimo,""
tc. Wo now appeal to tho statistics
found in tho compendium of tho census
of tho United States for 1850, page 82,
to ascertain what effect this prohibition
had upon slavery in tho different portions
of the North-West Territory. From tho
following table it will bo seen that in ev
ery portion of this vast Territory, African
slavery was introduced bv tho people, and
the number of slaves held 111 thoditlerent
portions of this Territory from 1810 to
840:

Thus it is seen that tho settlers in all
these Territories disregarded thcordiunncc
and in Illinois and Indiana slaves were
held bv hundreds. In tho last mention
ed territories slavery was established nnd
enfweil bn-loeji law passed by tho Tcr
u . 1 .1 . 1 , tmMi
years. JJut when tho pcoplo formed a
; ... 1 1 if 1 1 :
conslitutiou and asked for admission into
tho Union as Stales, thoy made provision
for tlio gradual abolition of slavery, be
causo they found that tho climato was too
cold, and tho productions of tho soil un
profitable. Tho people controlled tho
question in every respect, as they ever
have, in this country, and ever will, Jet
tho law of Congress bo what it may.
Although Illinois wns a part ot this
North-West Territory, yet il wns admit
ted as a Stato in 1818, with a constitu
tion recognizing slavery, nnd it wns uot
finally aWished until 1847, or twenty-
nino years after her admission.
In November, 1802, ti Territorial Con
vention was held at Vincenncs, composed
of delegates from every part of Indiana
Territory, then comprising also what is
now tho Slate of Illinois. Gen. William
Ilenrv Harrison, alias "" Old Tippecanoe,""
presided over the convenliou.and a memo
rial to Congress was prepared and passed
un'nnimously, and signed by General Har
rison as President of the convention.
This memorial petitioned Congress to re
peal 1110 clause in 1110 oruinanco promot
ing slavery. This memorial was referred
to ft commiltco who reported against
grunting the prayer of the petitioners, but
tjongrcss uiu not tako any lurincr nciion
upon it for some unknowu cause; prob
ably for want of lime, as tho committee
reported the day previous to tho linal closo
of that Congress.
The subject was considered by tho next
Congress and several committees were ap
pointed to consider tho memorial nnd re
port thereon, and thoy all reiortcd in fa
vor of qranting the prayer of tho petition
ers. Hut Congress still neglected tg act
upon it, until tho pcoplo of tho territory
tired of delay, took tho law into their own
hands, and tho Icrntorial Legislature ety
acted a stringent 6lavo codo for tho Tcrri
lory, and established slavery therein by
law, 111 defiance of tho ordinance.
Id Illinois ft very slight slave codo was
cnacled by tho people nnd enforced during
tho existence of the Territorial government
and re-enacted ajter it became a otatc,
and continued in forco until 1847, when
it was repealed.
Slavery was finally abolished by tho
samo pcoplo and their children, becauso
they beenmo satisfied by experience that
slavo labor was unprofitable. And yet
tho modern black republicans persist in
rlniminrr lioforA tlifl twinln tlmt tlio States
of tho North-West aro now freo becauso
slavery was l ept out by the ordinance of
1787. Such an assertion only shows tho
ignorance of thoso who assert it. It may
bo said that in mosfc of tho Territories
carved out of tho North-West Territory,
such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio and Mich'
ignD, but few slaves wcro introduced, and
that the prohibition of slavery in 'the or-
dinanco of 1787 produced this result.
But such is. not the fact. Tho climate of
these Territories is .wholly unfit for slave
labor, ' and slavery never could have been
permanently established, because tho pco
plo found it unprofitable. Wo have no
desire or intention to defend slavery ns ft
domestic institution in any respect ' It is
undoubtedly a curso to tho slave holder,
a curse to tho soil, and ft wrong perpetu
ated upon tho rights of the slave. Wo
only wish to show that, right or wrong, it
cannot bo controlled by. Congress, but
that tho truo policy is to take tho subject
out of Congress ns nn' exciting bono of
contention, and Icavo iho'settleinent of
slavery or no slavery ? with tho people in
all cases. . Intemperance nnd gambling
ar nUo great, cyiU but . Congress never
attempted to prohibit, tho sale of liquor
in a AtTniory, or promoii gamuung.
Why then should it attempt to prohibit
or establish slavery, while it leaves ALL
O Illicit domestic nnd local matters to bo
settled by tho people
Popular Sovereignty in Oregon.
It is claimed by tho republicans that
Oregon is now a free State becauso in '48
Congress in organizing a Territorial gov
ernment for that Territory, prohibited
slavery therein. Tho history of Oregon
vhows that this prctenco is without any
foundation in fact, and nlso proves that
Popular Sovorcignty is ngainst tho spread
of Slavery. .
Previous to 1848 tho inhabitants of
Oregon had lived under a provincial gov
ernment formed by themselves. Cou
gross had neglected to ennct a Territorial
eroverument, and truo to tho instincts of
tho American people, tho settlers of that
far off land organized a govern men t,clect
cd officers, and enacted laws, among tho
first of which was one prohibiting slavery
in tho Territory, nnd passed by a unani
mous voto. This law:had been in force
several years beforo .slavery was prohibit
ed by net of Congress. 1 lenco Congress
only ratified what tho pcoplo had dono
years beforo. This law prohibiting slave
ry was enacted at an early, day in the
settlement of tho Territory, and coming
fresh from the people, secured Oregon to

The effect of ropxthrSovtrcignty in the
Tcrrxtgxies.
Previous to th admission of Cnlifor-
provincial government under which they
. , .... n f
lived for several year3. Mien a Consti-
. J. , , ., . .
tution was formed, slavery was prohibited
by a unanimous ""volo of tho convention,
and it was admitted a freo State. We
have already shown that Oregon was al
so made ft freo Territory by local law,
without tho aid of Congress. When
Congress passed a Territorial government
for tho lernlory of lown, tho act per
milted tho people to do as they pleased
under tho Territorial government, in re-
card to slavery and otjicr local questions
Tho people prohibited slavery and Iowa
is now a free btato. Congress, in lorm
ing a Territorial government for Wash
ington Territory, left the subject of slave
ry to tho people therein, and that lern
lory is now free. In 1850 Congress or
ganized Iho Territories ot Utah and New
Mexico, leaving tho subject of slavery to
bo controlled bv the people. While Utah
is still free from slavery bv tho choico o
Iho people, tho Tcrrilorial Legislature of
New Mexico has passed a law protecting
slavery. This is tho only 1 erritory where
tho principle of Popular Sovereignty has
been applied, that tolerates slavery ; nnd
tho llepublicnns make a great noiso over
tho fact that tho pcoplo in this instance
tolerated slavery. JJut New Mexico
principally settled by Southern emigrants
who would undoubtedly estauiisiied slave
y if Congress had prohibited it, as was
.ho caso in tho North-West Territory un
lcr tho ordinaneo of 1787. Put vhcn
emigration from tho North begins to bo
uiniiuu iu milt murj , lb euivijr
will, tho subject will bo reviewed and h
nally settled. If tho people decide in fa
vor of slavery, it is their burden and not
ours, nor tho business of Congress
In 1854 Territorial governments for the
Territories of Kansas and Nebraska wcro
passed by Congress, and through tho la
bors nnd influenco of Mr. Douglas, the
people were left free to regulate their local
and domestic institutions in their own
way, slavery included.
Tho people of both thoso Territories
havo spoken, nnd declared against tolera
ting slavery. Thus it will bo seen that
in all tho Territories in which tho pcopl
havo been left untrammcled nnd free from
any interference of Congress,slavcry is ci
ther directly prohibited by local law, or
kept out of tho 1 erritory by public scnti
ment, except in Nctt Mexico, which is as
likely to decide hereafter for freedom, as
any "" other Territory, w hen it shall bo
settled bv Northern emigration, ns it will
bo nt no distant day.
The Position of Parties.
In tho preceding articles we havo men
lioned all tho Territories iu which Con
gross ovor presumed to prohibit 6lavery
No act of prohibition was passed by Con
gross for 30 years after tho adoption of
tho Constitution, but tho subject of slavc-1
ry as well as oilier local and domestic in
stitutions was left to 'bo decided by the
people. Iho Territories organized with
in this fcriod comprised what aro now
nown as tho bouth-Woslern States nnd
slavery was extonded over them by law
at th limo of tho adoption of tho Con-
rri. irr 1 r
BUkuuou. .Missouri jompromiso was
rassed in 1820, and that part of it pro
hibiting SlaVcry was repealed in 1854.
We havo shown that beforo its rcpenl,
slavery began to bo introduced . into the
Territory over which it extended, and it
is ft well known fact, that sinco its repeal,
slavery has been .excluded from the greftt
er bharc of tho samo Territory, nnd Kan
sas is now asking admission into Union
as a frco'S'ftlo.
Wo leav5 It with iho reader lo answer
for himself, after examining tho history
ol this subject, whether ho believes that
the prohibition of slavery by Congress
without consulting tho wishes of tho peo-
ile, as advocated by the republican party,
:ias had any beneficial effect in preventing
tho spread of slavery. Iho Democratic
party wilh Douglas ns its leader, claim
that such prohibitory laws passed by Con
gress, not warranted by tho Constitution,
and in effect are a nitltity, and not worth
tho cost nnd labor of enacting them.
When tho people want slavery they will
establish it, when they do not want it
thev will prohibit it. and if they ever be
come tired of it or find it unprofitable and
detrimental lo Iheir interests, thev will
pass laws to rid themselves of it: nnd
thus control tho subject as fullv n3 all
other lx-al concerns. And in this coun
try, and under our Constitution, thero is
no power to prevent it, and there is no
reason why thero should bo. Tho Demo

Repeal of the Missouri Compromise
llejmblican JJypocrfsy. .
No charge has been so recklessly mndo,
or so determinedly persisted in, as that
tho Democratic part, by repeal ot the
socalled Missouri compromwyjtvere guilty
of a base violation of public' faith and a
criminal betrayal of precious rights. Tho
author of the bill by which that act was
accomplished, has from tho day of its in
troduction to Iho present time, been the
recipient of tho foulest abuse, lias been
held up to tho public gnzo as a traitor to
iho cause of freedom, nnd prayers have
been offered up imploring family bereave
ments ns a mark of divine pleasuro with
this public career. Wo propose to nolico
somewhat of iho history of this transac
tion (as well ns tho baso pretensions ot
1110 ncpuoiicnn party 111 mis connection,;
and ascertain il possible, who nro base vi
olators of public faith and criminal be
trayers ot puolic rights; wuo wnuo me
Missouri compromise remained on tho stat
ute book of the country, wantonly nnd
shamelessly trampled upon its provisions,
nnd repudiated its obligations.
Tho election of James Monroo wcil
ni""h prostrated tho fast waning hopes of
dying federalism, juuiicu, ueieiucu, us
nrineinliis nnd nolicv emphatically con
demned by the people, its leaders saw no
hope in tho futtiro savo in tho division of
their opponents. An opportunity, eager
ly seized, presented itself upon the appli
cation of Missouri for nn enabling act,
(ireparalory lo admission into the Union,
vnowing that tho people of tho now
State, as they had ft right under iho con
stitution, as well as tho treafy with
France, would ask adpiission with a con
stitution favorable lo slavery, they .deter
mined to opposo its admission on that
ground, hoping to crcato ft sectional ex
citement lo result in n division of tho
Northern Democracy, and their own ro
lurn to an nscendnncy in the national gov
ernment. Mr. Jefferson characterized tho
attempt nt the time, ns tho dying strug
glo of eclipsed Federalism. Tho attempt
to impose ft restriction of that kind, upon
n State nsking for admission as a co-equal
among Sovereign Stales, was so unheard
of nnd extraordinary, as to crcnto Iho
most intense excitomont, and to arouso in
tho minds of tho purest patriots, tho most
serious apprehensions for tho fato of the
Republic. Many, in tho langungo of Mr.
Jellersou, regarded it as the death knell
of tho Union. Tho rcstrielionisU wcro
defeated in their attempt upon Missouri,
tho excitement was calmed, nnd tho con
troversy ended, by the nnssngo of nn net
agreeing to ndrait Missouri without res
triction, nnd prohibiting slavery in tho re
mainder of tho Territory of Louisiana
north of 30 deg. 30 min. This lino, ex
tending to our western boundary, divid
ing tho Territory fairly between the North
and South was regarded as ft finnl settle
ment of the question of slavery to bo re
garded in nil future limo. '
All 13 J'lUlLIJ'IU Ul UIM1I""IJ nuo M""u-
ishment of geographical lino between the
different sections of tho Republic, was,
however, regarded as a fatal step by the
fathers of tho country, then living. Jef
ferson and Madison declared it to bo in
violation of the constitution, and so strong
ly impressed wns Mr. Monroe with
tho soundness of their opinion, that lie
prepared ft veto of tho bill, ft draft of
which is now on file in the department at
Washington, giving iu full tho reasons
which induced him to tako such a step.
Afterward satisfied, that in tlio then em
bittered stato of public feeling no better
adjustment of tho difficulty could bo ef
fected, and fearing for tho fate of tho U
nion if tho strife continued, ho yielded his
convictions to tho pressure of tho times,
nnd approved tho bill. This settlement
wns exticmely distasteful to many in tho
North. Tho representatives who voted
for il, wcro driven from their positions
and wcro pursued in their retirement wilh
nil tho blind fury and savngo malignity
of abolitionism.
Noithern States instructed their repre
sentatives to disregard and trample upon
its provisions now 60' sacred, which they
did effectually, as we shall have occasion
to show. Missouri formed her constitu
tion nnd npplied for admission nccording
lo tho terms of agreement. A resolution
to ndmit her passed tho Sctiato nnd was
sent to the House, whero noithern and
anti-slnvcry men defeated it, refused to
admit her, and voted her out of the Union,
in defiance of ththow irreparable compact.
Did those nnli slaveiy men deem that
compromise binding on conscience nnd
honor, nnd tho faith of tho nnlion?
Wcro they burned in effigy becauso they
repudiated and trampled upon it.-i sacred
provisions?
At this crisis Henry Clay, then in tho
height of youthful popularity nnd power
Sitwppcd iuUj iho broach nnd proposed his
compromise for the admission of Missouri.
Nl'his net which became n law, and under
which Missouri was received into tho
Union, makes uo reference to the question
of slavery.
The ncl stands upon tho statute book
of tho country to-day, unrcpcaleoTntid ir-
repcalaole. . :
In 1830 Missouri asked nn enlarge
ment of her limits by the addition of a
largo strip of Territory on tho north,
which had 'been made freo by prohibition
of 1820. Tins could not bo effect cd with
out a violation of that sacred compact,
yet in the face of that net, Congress made
that addition.
During tho samo year Arknnsn.s, form
ed out of the Territory ncquired of France
nnd where slavery was allowed to go by
tho compromise of 1820, asked lo be ad
mitted into tho Union. Northern men,
in violation of that compromise, opposed
her admission because of her slavery con
stitution, nnd when nccused of unfaithful
ness in that line, they boldly answered
that they did not regard its obligations.
Agnin in 1854, when it wns proposed to
insert in tho resolution for the admission
of Texas, a clauso extending tho liuo of
30 degrees and thirty minutes through
that Territory, and prohibiting slavery
north of said line, wo find eighty-two
votes recorded ngainst tho proposition iv.
tho llouso of Reprcsentnlivcs, from tho
north, ntnong which nro Hamlin, Hale,
Collamcr nnd Giddings, all of them shin
ing lights in the temple of black republi
canism; men who daily imploro high
heaven to avenge tho rejal of lhat sa
cred compact. '
During tho session of 1848, n commil
tco wns appointed in the Senate, compos
ed of four Northern and four Southern
Senators, to consider tho measures pro
posed for tho organization of Oregon,
California nnd New Mexico. A southern
member of Iho commiltco proposed to
extend tho Missouri Compiomiso lino to
tho Pncific, forever excluding slavery from
ono million six hundred thousand square
miles of Territory north of that line,
whilo in the Territory south of lhat line,
amounting to only two hundred nnd sev
enty thousand squaro miles, tho people
wcro to bo left to dispose of the question
as they saw fit. That proposition receiv
ed the voto of every southern member of
tho committee, and was opposed by eve
ry northern member, and was defeated.
During tho samo session, on substantially
iho samo proposition, wo find recorded in
tho negative, tho names of Corwin, Ham
lin nnd Hnlc.
When tho Oregon bill was before tho
House, rt southern representative propos
ed lo amend tho prohibition of slavery by
adding that Inasmuch fts tho Territory
was north of, and covered by, tho Mis
souri restriction,"" when we find 113 votes
principally from nortlierrj States, in tho '
negative, 82 printigally from the south
iu tho afliimnlive, thus refusing to rccog
nizo tho act of 1820 in iho sligbe$t man-.
ner. Tho bill coulaiiiincr tho prohibition '
was approved by a southern president,
simplv becauso it wns not inconsistent
vith tho net of 1820. In 1820 Johu P.
Halo was eo fearful that ho bhould recog
nizo Iho imaginary line, ns he called it, of
30 degrees and CO minutes, lhat he refus
ed to innke it tho boundary lino of ono of
the Territories of tho United States.
Tho presistant refusal of tho north to
carry out in good faith lhat compromise, '
moro than anything else created iho excite- .
ment, nnd led to tho compromise meas
ures of 1850. Ouo of'lhoso measures
was an agreement to leave tho Territories
of Utah and New 'Mexico, tho exclusive '
right to regulate tho question of slavery
for themselves. Tho whig and democttio
parlies regarded thoso measures as a
.""settlement, in principle nnd sultstanco,
of tho questions involved."" and pledged .
themselves to carry them out in good faith
and in the election of 1852 they wcro
triumphantly sustained.
In 1853 a bill for tho organization of
Washington Territory, passed Congress.
Peing the first enactment after tho coni
promiso measures of 1850, wo most uatu
raly refer to it ns nn exposition of tho
doctrine embodied therein. This Terri
tory wns originally included in, nnd orgnn
ized under tho Oregon bill of August
1848, whioh contained ft prohibition of
slavery. Dut in the bill of 1853, making
ft division of tho Territory and organizing
a portion of tho samo under tho namo of
Washington, the prohibition contained in
tho bill of 184 8,. was repealed in th
following words: 'lhat all prohibitions or
law prior to September 1st, ,1848, shall
bo inoperative and void."" That bill passed
tho house of Representatives by . n two
third vote, and passed tho Scnato nearly
or quite unanimous. '
No one can havo tho hardihood to deny
but the construction thus placed upon
the compiomiso measure of 1850 is in
exact accordance- with the letter nnd spirit
of those mensures ns interpreted and
understood nl tho limo of their ndoption.
In conformity w it Ii the principles nnd
provisions of thoso measures which were
regarded ns n finality, this bill left tho
people freo niy.1 unrestricted to regulato
their .domestic concerns, repealing tho
prohibition in tho net of Congress of
Augiiot, 1818, prohibiting slavery over
tho Territory.
In 1854 Douglas ill I rod need tho Ne- 1
bt aska bill, and upon the subject of slavery
quoted iho precise langungo of tho com
promise measures of 1850, ""that tho
Territories or any portion of them, when
admitted ns States, might como into iho
Union with or without Slavery, ns ihey
saw fit to ordain."" Immediately, tho
black republicans charged him wilh de
signing witn iho uso 01 inni language, a
repeal of tho Missouri Compromise, nnd
Charles Sumner nnd S. P. Chaso in
solemn conclave on the Sabbath day, drew
up nn address to which they forged the
namo of Wm. H. Seward, accusing him
of such ft design, well knowing that tho
same langungo had been used four years
before, wilh tho approval of Clay nnd
Webster. Aflcrwnrds Douglas accepted
an amendment to his bill, declaring tho
net of 1820 incciisislent wish the compro
mise of 1850, nnd thercforo inoperative
and void.
Having trnced briefly tho history of
this celebrated . law, let us pause for ft
moment to consider tho result .of our
investigation.
Tho facl, too irresistably established
to bo disputed is, thnt from 1820 to
1850 the South ndhered to, nnd abided
by, and proposed to carry out in good
faith Ihc letter and tho principle of tho
compromise of 1820; while on tho other
hand, tho north repudiated it within ono
vear after its adoption, nnd ngain, tram
pled HiHUi its provisions and repudiated
its obligations. . Prominent among thoso
violators"" of law"", aro leaders of tho repub
lican party men who never failed tu op
pose and repudiate it up 'to 1854, when
thev suddenly declare tho act which they
had denounced for thirty years, to bo ft
sacred compact, irrepealable, and binding
011 tho honor of iho nation. No mao can
pretend that they wcro influenced by ft
particle of honesty iu making that' decla
ration. What has been the : course of
Mr. Douglas wilh reference lo this ques
tion. Entering Congress in . 1842, ho
found the act of 1820 ihc law. Not at
tempting to justify it on principle; be
lieving it to bo the opposition to tno prin
ciples upou which our govcrmcnt is based,
but if faithfully nnd honestly enrried out,
likely lo givo peace and quiet lo Iho
country, ho gave tho aid of his great ftbil
ities to tho accomplishment of that ob
ject, for which ho was denounced, in tho
most meager nnd savngo terms by tho pres
ent lenders of iho republican pnrly. Tho
principle of that act having been repudi
ated by its opponents in tho north, ho, in
1850, ""labored to givo forco nnd effect to
what ho considered to bo tho , truo prin
ciples of tl 0 govcrmcnt, uniting wilh Clay
nnd Wcbsler to sccuro that object. Tho

Said the distinguished John Randolph of
Roanoke, on the floor of Congress. 1820, in re-
rly to Edward Everett, ""Sir, I neither envy the
ead dot the heart of thnt mao from the North,
who rises here to dofend Slavery upon principle.""
Yet forty years after John Randolph, himself
slaveholder, administered this withering; re
buke to Northern defenders of slavery, we find
American clergymen standing before christian
audiences, Bible in band, defending Slavery upon
principle I Yes, while the church of God is
waiting, watching and praying for Messiah's
reign, to be consummated in fall millennial glory
on earth ; and the civil and religious despotisms
of the old world ure rocking to their very founda
tion and crumbling down under the increasing
light and progress of Society, and while the
New World, with Liberty inscribed upon her
banner, is responding to the advancement of the
old, with shouts of recent triumph : American
Divine would seem to be competing with pro
slavery congressmen, and corrupt politicians, for
tbe glory, or shame of offering American Slav
ery ""the vilest that ever saw the son,"" the de
fense and consolation of a Scriptural warrant ;
thus proving, by the authority of God, that de
grading man, made in the image of his Maker,
to the condition of a mere ""pergonal chattel"" a
thing that may lawfully be bought and sold like
a dumb brute, is not necessarily sinful and wrong
in the sight of heaven, but just and right, be
cause ordained of God 1 Thus the christian
sanctuary and the sacred desk become auxiliary
to oppression.
Among the more recent sensation sermons in
defence of slavery, probably the one pretched
in Brooklyn on Sabbath evening. Dec. 9th. '60,
by tbe Rev. IIknrt J. Van Dyke, pnstnr of tlio
First Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn, on
hThe Character and Influence of Abolitionism.""
ranks highest, and is regarded hy those of the
same faith as a masterpiece on the subject ;
hence has been Heralded and Expressed through
the nation as a sort of finality.
I readily concede to tbe author of this pro
duction, three things :
First. A pleasing popular style, well suited
to a fashionable audience a style of sermoniz
ing, wherein rhetoric greatly predominates over
logic, and brilliant words and fine sentences over
profound thought and sound criticism.
Skcond. I concede an apparent sincerity,
which always adds weight and influence to any
thing, even plausible in theory.
Third. I concede an uneqnivocal outspoken
advocacy of Slavery, so palpable and obvions
that the author will never require a Southern
pass, or Northern endorser in traveling South,
and residing where the system prevails in its
worst forms.
But, as to origioality of conception, or a
critical investigation of the meaning and use of
languoge, or definition of original words and
terms involved in this controversy, I can discov
er nothing of such merit in this production, af
ter the most diligent search. Its argumen's,
and its Scriptural quotations, are the most com
mon place, a new edition of old works on the
same subject, dressed in the author's own plau
Bible style, and well adapted to muke an im
pression at such a time as the present on a N.
York, or Brooklyn audience 1
Why did not Mr. Van Dyke condescend to
inform us, definitely, what he means by the term
Slavery, since he condemns all as such dunjier
oub characters, who believe slave-holdinif to he
sinful T Does he mean to teach that Hebrew
Servitude, Roman and American slavery, and
all other like, systems are one and the same
thing T Why not inform us whether Bondman,
Servant, and Slave all mean tbe same thing 7 or
if tbey differ, why not give us a few illustrations
or examples of tbe use of these words, in their
original application ? Why not explain the
meaning of ""buy,"" ""bought with money,"" ""bis
money,"" fcc, when such phraseologies are em
ployed by the Jews to express certain relations t
Certainly, a respectful deference to the opinions
of multitudes of the most leurued an pious
men the world has ever known, and the deci
sions of almost every ecclesiastical order in ex
istence, including tile General Assembly of the
Presbyterian Church of tbe United States,
should have led the author ol ibis sermon a-
gainst ""Abolitionism,"" professedly, to fortify well
every position in defense of Slavery, a system
of such doubtful origin and suspicious morals,
and so repugnant to the spirit and genius of our
nation, as a republican country.
With all deference to the author's talent, if
this sermon is a specimen of Mr. Van Dyke's
usual manner of conducting controversy, his
habits are altogether too loose to render his con
clusions safe or reliable, lie takes too much
for granted, where be knows men differ, and
where proof is demanded. He speaks of Mas
ters as Slaveholders, of Servants as Slaves, of
""buying"" servants, as if they were passive brutes
transferred by an owner, and of servants being
tbe ""money, and 'possessions"" of masters, in the
sense of cash and real estate ; whereas Mr. Van
Dyke must know, as a ""scholar,"" that neither in
Hebrew, Greek, or English, do these words bare
tucb a restricted meaning. Indeed, I deny iPOBt
unequivocally, that the Hebrew code has any
such words as ""Slave"" and ""Slaveholder"" in the
American sense. This should bave beea a la
bored point In Mr. Van Dyke's position, if be
intended to furnish Divine authority for slavery.
He shoald bave clearly set forth the chattel
doctrine, as defined and explained by the Amer
ican code, and then gone back to Patriarchal
days and the Mosaic code, and from tbe use of
Hebrew terms shown the Jewish and American
systems to be the same. To infer the Divine
origin of American, or any other slavery, from
Jewish servitude, as it was tolerated under tbe
Mosaio dispensation, is about as sensible as to
Infer the truth of Mormoniim from tbe existence
of polygamy among the Jews. Even should
we admit, for the sake of argument, that Jewish
servitude constituted a form of slavery, we
might supnose, on comparison with American
slavery, nS tana would Infer from this fact the
equity of the American system. But in regard
to slavery, our opponent seem to argue on tbe
prlnciple-ao Institution, one right, ia always
right J neither time, oor change, nor any degree
of apostacy can so vilWtt it, but wbat tbere re
mains ao inherent righteousness, which eutitles
it to vindication and Justification. Like the
Pope of Roue, it bos tu immutable! ever-eu-
doring succession, a divinely chartered existence
to the end or time, aud however corrupt, it can
never be wrong.
The inference has been drawn a thousand
times ""The Jews held servants by Divine per
mission ( therefore, American slavery is right.""
I propose to test this logic, by the means usual
ly accorded in controversy.
The Rev. Mr. Van Dyke proposes to discuss
the character and ii.flueuce of Abolitiouisra.

After announcing his text, five pages are de
voted to proving, thnt these servants were slaves;
that they bad believing Masters ; and in defin
ing the word ""Abolitionism,"" and stating his po
sition. How much the question, whether these
servauts under the yoke were slaves in the mod
ern sense, and whether their masters were true
believers, bns to do with the real issue, will be
an after consideration. As to his definition of
""Motitionism that an ""AbolUonist is one who
believes that slaveholding is sin, and onght
therefore to be abolished ;"" I confess it look a
little K!i8 calling everybody ""Block Repnblican""
that don t vote with modern Democracy I Does
not Mr. Van Dyke know, that many who are
conscientiously opposed to slaveholding as a
system, and believe it sinful, still maintain that
men may innocently sustain the legal relation,
wheu benevolence and tbe good of the slavo re-
3uire It. Bnt we accept the definition, since it
raws the line of demurkation sufficiently plain
between the mends and toes or impartial, uni
versal freedom, and while we welcome to onr
liberty-loving brotherhood men of every faith
and creed and nation, we would also remind lite
advocates and defenders of slavery, thnt they
too have a brotherhood, of allies, made, up of
quite as great extremes from the modest, hnm-
ble Northern apologist, down to tbe heartless
soul-drivers who reign on Southern plantations,
and piratical kidnappers, doomed to death by
tbe laws or onr country, who furnish the raw
material from Africa for American Slavery.
After defining ""Abolitionism,"" Mr. Van Dyke
states his positions, as follows :
1. Abolitiouism bos no foundation in the
8criptures.
2. Its principles have been promulgated chief
ly by misrepresentation and abuse.
3. It leads, in multitudes of cases, and by
logical process, to otter infidelity
4. It is the chief cause of tbe strife and the
danger that threatens our country.
Mr. Van Dyke ""proposes to discuss the char
acter and influence of 'Abolitionism,'"" and af
ter an introduction of five pages lays down his
four positions, as I have just stated them. He
then slates the First, viz : ""Abolitionism has no
foundation in the Scriptures,"" and enters at once
into an argument to prove that Hebrew servi
tude was a system of Slavery, so that Abolition
ism is to be proven unscriplural, by proving
slnvery scriptural. Now, in order to meet each
position of my Rev. opponent, I will adopt the
following course of reply :
1. Slavery has no foundation in the Scriptures.
2. Slavery has been promulgated, chiefly by
misiepresenlatioo and abuse.
3. Slavery, in a multitude of cases, and by
logical process, leuds to utter infidelity.
4. Slavery is the chief cause of the strife thnt
agitates, and the danger that threatens our
country.
My object in changing the terms, while I re
tain the order, is to vindicate rational Aboli
tionism by proving that Slavery is the criminal
tried and condemned by reason and revelation.
Slavery is an unscriplural system, promulgated
chiefly by misrepresentation and abuse tondiiivr
to infidelity, causing strife and endangering the
safety tnd welfure of onr country ; while aboli
tionism is the very opposite of slavery, both in
spirit and design, therefore tends to opposite
results.
Let me not be misunderstood on this point.
I take Abolitionism in the sense defined. ""An
Abolitionist is one who believes Slaveh Ming is
a sin, therefore ought to be abolished."" He may
be a Colonizationist, a gradual emancipationist,
a moral suationist, a legal suasionist. or acome
onter. According to Mr. Van Dyke's definition,
it is tbe faith that makes the man, anil not the
measures. I do not charge Mr. Van Dyke with
endorsing the African Slave Trade, because lie
endorses Slavery. Nor can he charge me with
endorsing extreme measures because. I endorse
the doctrine of Abolitionism, as laid down by
himself.
Again : Abolitionists believe thot slavehold
ing, as a system is sin, and ought therefore to
be abolished. Of course, then they do not be
lieve that it originated with the pure God, is
approved by Him, or is endorsed by the Reve
lation He has given us. When, therefore, they
hear old Abraham and other Patriarchs, and
Hebrew worthies denominated ""Slaveholders,""
they regard it as profane and libelous I They
believe that Hebrew servitude was a benevolent
system,rre from all taint of ""chattelism,"" and
no more like American slavery, than the gov
ernment of Austria is like tbe purest Repub
licanism, or Christianity like Paganism.
But the advocates of American slavery, driv
en to the wall by the force of increasing light
and the progress of public opinion, and know
ing too well the bare-faced corruption of the
American system, to dare risk the argument on
its inherent merits, like a renegade, going
out of towu to prove his character good, they
are obliged to make a mission way back into
the twilight of tbe world's history, soon after
the flood, in search of testimony. And wbat
do they bring back as evidence t Why, Noah
cursed Canaan, and said ""A servant of servants
shalt thou be onto thy brethren;"" and a little
later in the world's history, good old Abraham
owned servants, ""bought with his money,"" and
""born in his bouse;"" aud still a little latter, lie-
brew servitude wag recognized and regulated by
law. This completes the chain of Old Testa
ment testimony But where is chattel slavery,
in all this display of words t I boldly answer,
JVo where ! It can't be found in tbe Old Tes
tament code.
Let me now bring Slavery to the bar and in
troduce the testimony of the Scriptures against
it. My position aQirjis,
1. Slavery bas no foundation iu the Scriptures.
r iRBT wnai is slavery 7 Webster says,
-uoouage : tne state or entire subjection of oae
person to tbe will of another. Slavery is the
obligation to labor for the benefit of the mas
ter, without the contract or consent of tbe ser
vant."" . But let us look into the American slave code
for tbe law defiuiug the relations and condition
of a slave :
""A Slave la on who la Id the power of a Muter, to whom
ha belonga. The mauler may aell turn, diapoee of hia peraoo,
hia induatiy and bin labor, be oao do oatiiing, poweaa nothing,
nor touuire anything, but what muat belong to bia MaaUr.""
Law i or LouiauaA-
The laws of South Carolina say. ""Slaves
shall be deemed sold, taken, reputed aud ad
judged in luw to be chattels personal, in the
hands of their owners and possessors, and their
executors, administrators and assigns, to all iu
tents constructions and purposes whatever.""
Judge Stroud says ""Tbe cardinal principle of
slavery that the slave is not to be rauked a
mong sentient being,, but among things is an
article of properly a chattel personal, abtaius
as undoubted law in all these states.""
Hence, it ta perfectly obvious, that the 'chat
teC principle Is the lift's blood, of Americun
Slavery. As a farther illustatioo of this fact,
bear a statement from the lawg of Marylund.
'In case the personal property of a ward shall
consist of specific articlus, such as slates, work
ing beasts, animal of any kind, stock , furniture,
plate, books, and 10 forth, tbe court, if it shall
deem it advantageous for the ward may at any
timo pass an order for the sale thereof.'
According to Blackstone, 'chattels personal,
are things moveable, as animal, furniture of a
house, jewels, corn, 4c.' Slaves, according to
the code of slavery, are 'chatties perionaL' Re
ducing men, therefore to slavery, is convertino
them Into property, as truly as cutching a wild
hnrse is turning him Into property. He ean Aa
nothing, acquire nothing, possess nothing. All
right to himself is abrognted, and he may be
bought and sold, and mortgaged and rented and
traded, the same as any other property.
And yet, Mr. Van Dyke says 'Abolitionism
is abusive in its persistent misrepresentation of
the legal principle involved in the relation be
tween master and slave. Its teachers reiterate,
in a thousand exciting forms, the assertion thnt
the idea of property in man blots out his man
hood and degrades him to the level of a brute,
or a stone.' Me then asks 'do not these Ano
litionist Philosophers know, that according to
the laws of every civilized country on earth, a
man has properly in his children, and a woman
has property in her husband.' No, Mr. Van
Dyke, neither Abolition Philosophers, nor any
other philosophers, unless they are Pro-slavery
rhilosnjihers, know, or believe any such doctrine,
as that fathers may have property in children,
husbands have property in wives, and wives
have procrty in husbands, in tbe true legal,
technical sense of property.
With all deference to Mr. Van Dyke's legal
knowledge. I confess a suspicion that this is a
dodge, a mere evasion of the real point at
issue. True, a father may have a right in his
children, a husband may bave a right in his
wife ; aud a wife may have a right in ber bus
band ; but are children a father's 'chattel t and
can he advertise and sell them at public auc
tion 1 Can husbands mortgage, or sell their
wives, as slaveholders do their 'chattels person
al' f Or can wives sell their hnshands whenev
er a change is deemed desirable t If not, then
there is no parrellcl between 'property in child
ren and husbands,' and property in slaves.
Mr. Van Dyke, evidently sees, that the 'chat
tel principle' applied to Hebrew servitude, will
be fatal to his Scriptural argument based on the
Old Testament ; hence,- the effort to explain
and soften down the doctrine of 'property in
man,' so 03 to harmonize it with Hebrew servi
tude, without impeaching the character of the
Bible. Hence, after a supposed case to prove
that a wife has property in her husband vie ;
the husband is killed on the Railroad and the
wife collects damages as if damages paid for
her loss he adds. 'Thus, the common law of
Christendom, and the statutes of our own state,
recogniz j property in man. In what does that
property consist ? Simply, in such services as
a man, or a child may properly be required to
render.' This is all the Levitical Law, or ny
other law means, when it says, 'your bondsmen
shall be your possession, or property and an in
inheritance for your children.'
According to this definition, it is not the man,
bnt the service, that constitutes the property.
'Chattels personal,' simply means services, and
not ;nen! Whenever a slaveholder sells a 'chat
tel,' he sells the services, hut not the man, be
cause the man is not property. Slaveholders
do not oira men, but services 1
This, certainly, is a distinction, not only with
out a difference, but also without an intelligent
meaning, when applied to 'chattel slavery.' Let
us consider its consistency before we adopt it
as a standard definition.
First : If rendering ""sucA services' ss may be
properly required of man, is all that slave laws
mean by 'chattels personal,' then wherein does
the 'bondage' consist ? And wherein does a
common laboring man, who renders 'such servi
ces a may properly be required.' differ from a
slave T Are we to infer, that ull employers are
slaveholders, nnd all working men slaves f
Second : If slavery with an iron grasp, holds
on to the ntin. while it grinds out the property,
or service, then how does this definition help
the poor victim of oppression, or viudicate the
morul churacter of slnvery 1 Is the slave less
miserable and degraded, or slavery less oppres
sive and wicked in the sight of God and man f
We object to this definition, when applied to
slavery, not only because it is a -blinder,' and
calculated to mislead honest men, and vindicate
luvery ; but because it is untrue both in fact
and principle, and is contradicted by every Blave
code on earth. Did the Roman laws which
claimed the right and power of life and death,
over the slave, consider the service, and not
tlie slave, property T The right to kill a man
for his services, is a strange right 1 The Ame
rican slave code, most emphatically declares
'That a slave is one that belongs to his master,'
Hint 'slaves snail ne aeemea soiii, tuken, repu
ted and adjudged in law to be 'chattel person
al.' in the hands of their owners, to all intent,
construction and purpose whatever.' If the
language of this code does not mean that slaves
are property, then law cannot express the idea
of proper in anything.
But while this deuniuon is utterly irreconcila
ble with the claims of slavery, it nevertheless
deuls a death-blow to all the pretended support,
that slavery derives from Hebrew servitude, not
withstanding the claim set op fur divme authori
ty. Mr. Van Dyke informs us, that 'All the
Levitical law, or any other law means, when it
says 'your bondsmen, shall be yoir possession.
or property, and an inheritance Tor your child
reu,' is that their services, such services as a
man may properly be required to render,' con
stitute the property 1 Of course, then, Hebrew
servants were not slaves, either iu tbe Roman
or tbe American sense of the word; ao i to as
sume it is a perversion of Scripture.
But, notwithstanding, Mr. Van Dyke's plau
sible definition of 'property in man,' I ratber
suspect from his quotations and expositions of
the 'Levitical Iaw,' that when we come to the
bottom line of his system, we shall find slavery ;
that 'property in service, is ouly a new name
for an old sinner wbo wishes to escape by de
nying his identity. Indeed, after quoting from
Leviticus, Mr. Van Dyke says in so many
words,' know, from tht plain passage, I have,
quoted, and many more like it, that he (God)
did sanction slaveholding among hi ancient peo
ple, 4c. p. 9. So then by the sort, gentle terms
proper services' we are to understand slavery
with its chattelism and involuntary servitude
forever. Huw he know that God sanctioned
slaveholding among the Jews, while multitude
as competent and candid deny it, may be a ques
tion for modest inquirers.
Mr. Van Dyke does not go back to Noah's
curse upon Canaan for evidence of slavery, as
many others nave uone I ior aoet ne stop to
consider the case of Abraham, wbo is usually
rerarded by our opponents as tbe Prince of
Old Testament Slaveholders ; but merely says.
'Passing by the records of the Patriarchal age,
and waiving the question as to those servants
in Abraham's family, wbo in the simple, but ex
pressive language of scripture 'wer bought with
his money' let us come at once to the tribunal
of that luw, which God promulgated amid the
solemnities of Sinai.' He then gives as the
law, astound in Lev. xxv. 3941 aud 44, 43,46,
verses.
'And If thy brother that dwelletb by thee be vuaa poor and
be eold unto tbae, thou ahalt not compel him to aerveaaa

with thee and atuall aerve thee unto the year of Jubilee, and
theo aball be depart fioin thee, both be aud bia ehUdroa with
bin..'
Thus far tbe law defines the relations of Jew
ish servant. They are said to be told, yet are
to serve as 'ir-servuts.' Tbey were by right
free at the end of six years, yet might compel
ihoir masters to keep tbem longer. Now a these
Hebrew servants were free before they were
sold, the question arises, wbo SolJ them. I an
swer, tbey sold themselves, iu Other words, con
tracted their service. Of course then every
thing wa voluntary, and there was do slavery
But let os consult tbe Levitical Law

In these passages we find the full relioble
strength of the pro-slavery, scriptural argument.
These are among the grand proof-text to vindi
cate American Slavery on divine authority. If
these do not prove that slavery is a scriptural
institution, then there is no proof in the Bible.
The simple question, is do these passages, or
any others, teach the existence of Chattel
Slavery,' in the American sense of the word ?
Were the Jews slaveholders under the provi
sions of ibis Law, and their slaves property ?
1 am aware, that some anti-slavery writers
speak of Jewish servitude, as a mild form of
Slavery, and or bondmen, as sla ves. But they
wholly deny the chattel element, unless in speak
ing of criminal or captive taken in war. I
take the American definition, as the true one.
and affirm that God neither gave sanction, nor
tolerated 'chattel slavery' in the Hebrew Com
tnonwealtb j nor did the nation ever practice
it, unless after they apostatized, and theo God
rejected them.
It is a striking fact, that there is no word in
the Hebrew language for ilave ; bence the
Translators never use the word in translating.
Hence, no word synonymous with tlave, ever
entered into the Hebrew code. Had God no
design in thus carefully excluding such a word.
'Bnt, surely, say the advocates of slavery, the
word 'Bondmen' is eqnivolent to tlave and muni
mean the same thing.' Theargnmentof Mr. Van
Dyke for Hebrew slavery, seems to be based,
mainly, on the conclusion that 'bondmen and
slove' are synonymous terms.
This I deny. And this Mr. Van Dyke does
not attempt to prove by a single criticism, or
allusion as to the use, or meaning of the origi
nal word I Had he faithfully told his bearers,
that there it no Hebrew word for slave, that the
word translated bondman,' is also translated
'tervanf and denotes any one serving iu any ca
pacity, it might have Created some doubts as
to the soundness of bis conclusions. Kuppose
I call attention to the lauguageof the Levitical
luw, as quoted
First : I give a literal translation of the He
brew text, by 'a citizen of Virginia, a geutleman
of candor and acholarship.'
Verse 44 And thy man-eervant and tliy maiden which
ahalt be to the (hall te from the nationa which aurmtind

In this translation, tho words enclosed in
parenthesis, are not in the original, but are sup
plied to render the reading more natural to the
English reader. Tbe words. eveJh and amav.
translated 'bondmen' and 'bondmaids' in the
common translation, are both in the singular
number in the Hebrew and in the sixth verse of
this same chapter are translated 'servant' and
'maid,' and should have been so translated in
this verse, instead of 'bondmen' and 'bondmaids.'
The word translated 'heathen' should be render
ed 'nation' as more literal and true to tbe ori
ginal. But let us examine the import of the word
bondman' more critically and see if it is synony
mous with the word 'tlave,' or will admit of
such an interpretation, lhe word slave is
definite, and always means one and the same
thing, unless used figuratively. Technically, it
means a literal slave, one in bondage, such as is
imposed by the American slave code. When
we speak of men as 'slaves to lust,' or 'passion,'
or when we bear the slaveholders taunt 'white
slaves of the north,' no candid person under
stands that literal slave are intended. The
word 'tlave' therefore and its significance is well
understood, and no intelligent person is in dan
ger of confounding it with something else,
some other relation, or condition. Slave means
slave, and literally, nothing else, it is tho legal
word for 'chattels personal.' The Hebrew em
ployed one word to denote servitude of any
kind, and that word was ebcdh, correctly and
properly translated 'servant.' This is the word
that our translators render 'bondmen.' Now
to attach the idea of slave to this word would
not only be false in fact but absurd in theory.
Suppose we give a few examples of the use of
this word and render it slave. Juduh when
pleading before Joseph for Benjamin is made to
say, 'Now therefore when I come to thy slave.
my father, &c.' But was Jacob the slave of
Pharaoh T Again 'let thy slave abide instead
of the lud, a slave to my Lord.' So, the Queen
of Sheba speaking of tbe officers of Solomon's
Court is made to say according to this version ;
'Happy are these tby staves which stand con
tinually before thee.' Saul's officers and sol
diers must be his slaves, David is Jonathan's
slave, Abigail is David's slave, and so of a
multitude of cases where minister's and worship
pers of the true God and men in every variety
of service miiot be slaves ; if tbe word transla
ted 'bondmen' means slave 1 Yet this is the
key-stone in the arch of Bible slavery. Had
the Hebrew word been translated servant, as it
should have been, slavery would never have fled
to the Levitical Law and seized upon the word
bondman' in order to vindicate 'chattel slavery,'
The translators being familiar with a system of
'villeinage' peculiar to their country and wish
ing to express a difference between 'hired ser
vauts' of Jewish birth, and servants of other
nations, under longer contract of service, and
perhaps less favored, used the term 'bondmen ;'
but never with a thought of expressing 'chattel
slavery,' or tliey would bave used tbe word
slave, instead of tbe equivocal term 'bondmen.'
But, we are told, these boudmeu' were 'bought
with money,' therefore they must bave been
slaves, or property.
The word 'buy 'bought' 'bought with mo
ney,' &o. is very far from expressing the idea of
'property in man' iu tbe sense of -chattelism.'
This tbe most common reader of tbe Bible may
know, simply by taking bis concordance and
looking out tbe word. The common Hebrew
word is 'kaunau' and accord ng to Geseniua, the
highest authority, means 'to found, create, to
get, gain, obtain acquire, potsest, vurchate, buy,
4c' Wbo would ever think of deriving slave
ry from this word. But were person bought,

Io the light of such criticisms, I now ask,
wbat is tbat argumeut worth, that iufers ""chat

bought, bondmen,"" to. When we speak of a
tlave, iu connection wit b the American system,
everybody knows what we mean, without ask

definition to Hebrew servitude, and not to slav
ery, and said that the ""money, or possession, or
inheritance consisted in such services as a man
may properly be required to render."" he would
hsve been nearer the truth, and escaped tbe re
buke of the slave code.
He who lawfully held a servant, was entitled
to his services his services were his property
his wages a possession, and dying, the services
of that servant became the dower of his chil
dren. This exposition is scriptural nnd natur
al, and does not involve Ood and bis people in
""chattel slavery."" But that Hebrew servitude
and American slavery differ in their fundamental
piinciples, and are consequently different sys
tems, entirely unlike each other, ""is so palpable
and evident, that even the Rev. Doctor Ra-
. U II f t . ...

pii-N, in ma great sermon in isew York, on
""The National Fast Day,"" makes the following
remarkable concession, although he is trying to
vindicate slaveholdinir on Bible p-rounds. He
says, speaking of tbe humanity of the old tes

So then, the Roman and American view of
slavery is tbe rrathkn vikw, which reduce! the
slave to a thing j therefore, the Roman and
American view is anti-Bible, anti Old Testament,
and anti Hebrew servitnde. This concession
deals a death-blow to all claims set up for A mer

it can oe shown that tnnie ann heathen views
do not essentially differ, althoogb the Bible pro
claims and demands the riehts of men. while
heathens deny and refuse them I Hence, Dr
Raphall virtually admits what Abolitionists
claim, via : American slavery has on foundation
in the Scriptures, because it is tbe heathen
view of slavery 1
Having considered the meaning of those
words and phrases most relied upon, to prove
the existence of Old Testament slavery, and
shown beyond successful contradiction tb'ti
they furnish no ronf, whatever, of 'chattel i
slavery,' I now invite attention to some general
facts and principles, establishing my position.
First. Abraham is claimed as a slavehold
er, because he had servants who were 'bought
with his money' and 'born in his house'. We
Bod, on one occasion, Abraham arming 318
'trained"" servants to rescue Lot, who had been
taken prisoner by certain kings. Now, if he
could arm 318, then his servants must have
numbered in all, counting families, some 1 500
or 2000 souls. Does any man believe that these
servants, were slaves, bought up, and born io
his bouse I In Gen. 12 : 5, we are told Abra
ham left Haran, with Sarai, his wife, and Lot.
his brother's son 'and the souls they hsd gotten
in llarun.' Now these souls, were the servant
they had gotten in Haran. The Jerusalem Tar
gnm and Chaldee Paraphrase say 'all the tout
which he had subdued unto the law.' And when
we read '318 trained servants.' the Hebrew
reads catechised servants.' These servants,
therefore, were protelytrt. who believed in Abra
ham's God and Religion. When Abraham
left Haran, they voluntarily went with him.
He had paid them a consideration for their ser
vices. they were converts to his religion, and
now cheerfully follow him, as bis servants and
snbject ; bnt not as slaves. To suppose thut
he armed a gang of 318 slaves, and pursued an
enemy, is sufficiently absurd without refutation.
Tbey most have differed very essentially from
modern 'chattels' or the old patriarch might have
found his troop marching iu quick time hack
. . I I C I I -J.I ,1
to taran. .ong oeu re ne reacneo tne nauieneia
But as subjects and servants, worshippers of
the same God and united to him by
interest, they were perfectly reliable.
Second. The Jews, themselves, were
once in bondage, or as some say slavery.
By looking into theipcondition, we may bet
ter understand the use of terms and the
difference between slnvery and servitude.
While in Egypt, they are said to be in lie
house of bondage,' they were Pharaoh's
bondmen, 'Their lives made bitter with
hard bondage,' they were under 'task
masters' and their condition is represented
as 'hard' 'oppressive' and 'grievous.' Cer
tainly, Hebrew servitude was no worse, nnless
God sanctioned in Canaan the oppression
he condemned in Egypt. But was Evp
tian bondage 'chattel slavery' were the

tered among the Egyptian families 2J.
They owned the hind of Goshen, the very
best land in Ktcypt, and occupied it for a
a possession ail. I ney owneo docks ana
herds and mnch cattle 4th. I hey lived in
permanent houses and were well fed and
clotbed-5th. They were all well armed
6th. They worshipped their God without
restraint.
Does this look like American Slavery J
If Hebrew servitude imposed no'hing worse,
then, it was infinitely preferable to Amer
icun Slavery Yet this was such bondage
as God condemned, auifor the practice of
which, the Egyptian were utieily over
thrown. If American slavery is not sinful,
then I defy any man to prove that there
was anything wrong in Egyptian bondage;
unless, what was wrong iu the dark ages of
the world, is ull right in the nineteenth cen
tury. In order to test the claim of American
Slavery, to divine sanction, I now pro
pose to compare the two systems Hebrew
Servitude and Americau Slavery.
First. The Hebrews, or Jews, obtained
their servants, by purchase, unless captives
taken iu war. Tho Hebrew code contains
no record warranting tho conclusion, tbat
ciiminals were punished by bondage. Steal
irfg and kidnapping men, was punished with
death. Hence tbe only means of obtaining
servants was to buy tbem. Tbia purchase
wa a mutual, vuoluotary transaction. If
servants were bought of the third person
and carried by force, or against their will
into servitude, it would be oppression, or in
effect, stealing or kidnapping. If stealing
I taking without liberty wbat don't belong
to os, then acquiring servants by force, or
without their consent, must be stealing, so
long as man has a right to himself ; hence
the Jews bought their servauts.
Second. 1 am sorry to be obliged to say
American slaves, were originally acquired
by kidnapping and theft, aud tbat we oow
hold them as ""stolen goods,"" that is, re
reivers. How was slavery established in
this country, and wbeu aud bow did we gel
onr slaves f When our llev. casuist bat
tle abolitionists for believiug that American
slaveholdiug is sin, and ought to be abolish
ed, aa a means of qnickening their moral
tierr-emions. wft recommend this feature of
A ma, l.-nn aUterv to their consideration Par-
bapu, if tbe African slave trade if s wheel
id ft wheel, aud Ood's providence does work
'
I
ont a good, man' piracy rosy not be en
dorsed, even if slavery Is.
Third, instead of a fugitive slave law to
return slaves, Ood passed one to aid and
secure tbeir escape. It reads as follows :
Prrr. xxtll i IS. 18. ""Thou ahalt not deliver onto hi. maa-
er the eervant which ta earmned from hia matr nnlo th.. ,
be ehall dwell with thee, even among yon in the plw which
he ahall chooee In one of the valea wliem It llkeih l.w ti .
Thou ahalt not nppreea him I""
As coni-lusive evidence that he was not
a slave, or property, if the servant, wag not
well nsed, or did not like his master, he
conld leave, and wo he to the man who de
livered him op to the master. This law
protected him in his rights, and proves that
he might quit the service of his master when
wrongrd. The law is imperative. ""Thou
shall not,"" &c. The evasion of this law by
a dinning that heathen were not permitted to
sit ze their rnn-sways among; the Jew, is un
worthy of consideration, as if Jews lived on
such irood terms with the idolatrous nations
j about them, or heathen would come among
tbem looking for fugitive slaves.
KorxTH. But the American code
"" Thou shall deliver the servant.,"" &r. No
matter how much outraged, he is a chattel.
and mast be delivered np, if the whole U.
S. force is necessary : ""blood honnds "" and
more blood thirsty men. hunt him like a wild
beast of prey, and if they overtake him, he
is doomed to heavier chains for even daring
to fly from the oppressor, and from a bond
age worse than death.
Fifth. Under the Hebrew code, nearly
one half of the time the servant was ex
empt from labor, or about 23 years out of
50. Hence he was never over-worked, and
had ample time for bis religion and social
life.
Sixth. Flow does this benevolent provis
ion accord with the American code. By
some, it has been said, that the average of
a slave's life on cotton plantations, was from
tertn to ten years. Such is the wear and
tear of slavery. A slave sees few days of
rest, and brief are the periods for his reli
gious devotion; while social life, where boa-
hanils and wives, parents and children are
bound together by no leiTa! tie. is a delusion.
Seventh. The Hebrew code every fiftieth
year, passed a Universal Emancipation Act,
in the following words :
I.ar. ITT ! ""And re shall hallow the fiftieth rear and nen-
elaim LihtrUi Ikrarngk mil tht land unf ai l the Inhabitants
tnereoi : 11 atutii ne a jubilee nnto you, and ve aball return
every man unto hia poteeeatoa, nod re aball return every man
Mr. Van Dyke says the ""Abolitionists
have blown this jubilee trumpet with a zeal
worthy of a better cause."" This may ac
cord with the views of such as defend slav
ery npon principle, lie then, in a few
words denies that the year of jubilee had
any application to ' bondmen of foreign
birth,"" Then we are to understand, that
when God says ""proclaim liberty through
out all the land, onto all the inhabitants
thereof,"" it only menus Jews, while others
are to continue in bondage ! But the Jew
ish servants, we are told, went ont free
every seventh year, therefore did nof, need
the fiftieth year of jubilee. In Is. lvhi: 6,
we find instruction a-i to what constitutes
an acceptable fast : ""Is not this the fast
that I have chosen, to loose the bonds of
wickedness, to ondo the heavy burdens and
to let the oppressed po free, and that ye
break every yoke."" But could the Jews
break every yoke, while thousands of bond
meirwere still under i he yoke? Were none
oppressed but Jewish servants ? The year
of jtlhiIee WM t0 end oppreon to hreilk
J ,. . , : ,., . '
erery yoke, and proclaim liberty to all the
inhabitants of the land. It is tbetefore ab
surd to soy it only referred to Jews, when
God says it refers to all the inhabitants of
the land. Such an interpretation is a sort
of Judge Taney decision, denying citizen
ship to colored men.
Eh.htu. American slavery has no year
of jubilee. It dooms the slave to ceaseless,
endless bondage, till death emancipates and
ses him free.
Wo might notice other benevolent fea
tures in the Hebrew code, proving it as nn
like the American system as noon day is
unlike midnight. For example : Hebrew
servants could not le sold ; American slaves
can be sold. Hebrew servants, when cru
elly treated, were made free ; American
slaves are never treed on account of abuse.
Hebrew servants were entitled to equal re
ligions privileges with the master ; Ameri
can slaves are to a great extent cut off
from religious privileges. Hebrew servants
were carefully instructed in families, the
same as other members of the household ;
American slavery denies education to the
slave, and makes it penal to teach htm to
read or write. Hebrew servants enjoyed
family relations ; American slaves do not,
their wives and children may be taken away
at pleasure. Hebrew servants could ou
property ; American slaves can neither ac
quire, or own anything.
Having thus far confined onr inquiries to
Mr. Van Dyke's ""Levitical Law,"" or Old
Testament argument for slavery, I now call
your attention to his New Testament the'
ory, which may be more readily disposed of.
Not that I have, by any means, exhausted
the overwhelming testimony of the Old,
against slavery ; indeed, I have scarcely
noticed Ood's denunciation of oppression
in every form, nor the precepts and teach
ings of that moral code whjch lays slavery
under an eternal ban. We have passed
over the predictions of Isaiah, Jeremiah,
and other prophets, whose language glares
with retributive wrath against tbe oppres
sions of the poor, and sucb as torn aside
the stranger from his rights. Slavery is
cursed and doomed from Genesis to Mnla
chi, without a sentence, word, or syllable
to show God's approval, or sanction of the
""chattel doctrine,"" as taught iu this coun-
MM
and all attempt to fatner u npon
"" t . . i . L - A
Hebrew servitude owy prove- mo uw.a
tion of a system, goaded to maduess by tbe
light and progress of the world
Mr. Vn Dyke's argument, drawn from
the New Testament, is a most remarkable
example of special pleading, far-fetched in
ferences, bold assumption, and consummate
dogmatism. A quotation will illustrate it.
After affirming that Uavery ""existed an
over tbe civilized world"" when the Saviour
came, and was as ""common as it is to-day
in South Carolina;"" aud after saying, ""It
is not alleged by any one having any pre
tension to scholarship or tandttr, that tbe
lloinau laws regulating slavery vert even
as mild as the very wortt statutes, which
have been ptssed upon tbe subject lo modern

I confess that
... . j ... ' ' 1
I reRti this part of Mr.
Van Dyke's sermon with astonishment, and
wondered, if a New York or Brooklyn
andience could be fonnd to endorse it, evert
when heated np with secession excitement f
or if country readers coold be found to be
lieve it.
I pass by the asnmption that slaver was
so universal and common when our Saviour
came ; and that masters and slaves met
Christ and his apostles at every step, ana
were present in every andience, to notice
some other glaring essertion.
First. He says. 'It Is not alleged
anyone, or at least, by any having any pre
tentions to scholarship or canlor, tbat the
Ihman law regulating slavery, were even
as mild as the very vorst siaUUtt which'
have been passed upon the snbject in mod
ern times.' Assumption, wholesale asser
tion seems to he a favorite mode of reason
ing with Mr. Van Dyke, when on the sub
ject of slavery J Does he mean to assome
hat all scholarship and candor resides in
in the advocates of slavery 1 Or was he
ignorant of the fact that many men whose
scholarship and candor have ranked quite
high as bis own have maintained that
'American Slavery is the vilest, that ever
saw the so n r J leaven only can measure
the enormity of Roman laws on the subject
of slavery, if they were worst than any of
modern times. Mr. Rice, of Kentucky
speaking of the laws that confine the slave,
says they are 'consigned to a bottomless
gnlf of wretchedness.' The Maryville Irf
telligencer SHys 'the condition of slaves ia
the southwestern states is second onh to
that of the wretched treaturain hell. The
synod of Kentucky says 'they svjfcr all that
can be inflicted by wanton caprice grasping
avarice, brutal lint, maligna t spite, and
antanctr Now if Roman laws, and Ro
man slavery, were still worse, then perdi
tion, itself can hardly furnish a parallel of
wretchedness. Ta-sing, I would1 as, .watt
Roman slavery sinful, and those bad laws
only abuses J Did Roman laws regulating
slavery, hold that 'men ttat fiof property
only his 'serrzeer were property.' If Christ
and his apostles believed, tbat such slave-',
holding was nnand onght to be abolished,
were they not Abolitionists ? Or did tbey
defend npon principle such slavery? Or
did their 'itMer silence' signify approval.
Second. After Mr. Van Dyke assumes,
and claims all candid scholars, as agreeing
with him thatRomnn laws regulating slave'
ry, were not even ss mild as tbe Worst stat-'
ntes of modern times, be informs os, that
although Christ and his apostles met it at
every step and in every audience, still they
were 'vtterly silent' in regard to the sinful-""
ness of slaveholding. He tells ns, tbat the
condemned every ackwrwledgtd tin, in nn-'
measured terms, 'drunkenness and adultery,
theft and murder' 'all the moral wrongs,
which ever hnve been knowu to afflicted
society, are forbidden by name,' and yet
slaveholding 'is never spoken of except irJ
respect f ul terms ."" Then, according to Mr.
Van Dyke's own showing modern statutes
upon the subject of slavery are 'bad,' but
Roman laws were 'worse.' If I understand
corammon English Grammar, comparison1
runs in the direction of 'bad, worse, worst,
and uot 'good, worse. So then we have,
indirectly, at last, the coufession tbat, both
iu the Roman and American code tbere are""
bad lairs ; but although Roman laws gave
slaveholders the power of life and death
over the slave, still neither Christ not the
apostles ever alleged that slaveholding was ""
sinful, bnt were utterly silent.' Let those .
believe this who can. And we might add,
if they were thus silent, what does it proveT
Tmnn. But, silence is the mighty argu
ment, when we approach the New Testa
ment with the question of slavery. Mr.
Van Dyke says ""It is a remarkable fact,
which the Abolitionist does not, becatfse he
cannot deny, that the New Testament is
utterly stL nl in regard to the alleged sinful
ness of slaveholding."" Now, itf the first
place, I deny that any intelligent, sane Abo
litionist ever maintained, thtt the New
Testament is ""utterly silent"" ort the sinful
ness of slaveholding. The precepts and
teachings of Christ and the apostles af e Con-""
initially leveled against this sirt by Aboil
tiouM. lltnc, tor Mr. V an Dyke to as
sert that Abolitionists admit the siltike
""utter silence"" of the New Testament in re
gard to the sinfulness of slaveholding, be
trays an unaccountable ignorance of Aboli
tionism or sotnethiag worse. It is repre
senting them as virtually yielding the Bible
argumeut, while he onght to kurfw that the
New Testament has been the mighty wea
pon against slavery, in the bands of patriots,
philanthropists and christians, ia every age
of the world, and that bit own church, by
iU Geuerul Assembly, boasts of being
among the first in ""the good work of en
deavoring to pot an erUl to slavery,"" because
to the ""Gospel of Christ.""
DIGEST, p. 343.
But suppose we should admit that Christ
and the apostles were silent on the sin of
slavebolJing, how does their silcuce prove It
riirht f Such a rale of testimony would
prove some of the most flagrant evils, siu
less and right.
First. At our Savior's advent ths Ha
inan government was infected to its very
center with Idolatry I Where did Christ
directly ever say a word against Idolatry
He never named it once 1 By Implication
of course, he condemned It ; but b was
""utterly silent,"" so far as any open rebuke
or condemnation was concerned I Are wa
to iufer that Idolatry was not sinful, be
cause the Savior did not 0eiilv assault it I
Second In the time of Christ and his
apostles, every Roman father poesessed the
power of life and death over bis child.
When tbe child wat born, it was lor tho
father to say whether it should be reared or
left to die I If bo decided It should die.
It was left by ths roadside to perish, or to
be picked op by any ono who cared to ssvo
it. Such conduct was Inhuman, opposed to
the law of God, tod the Gospel of Christ,
But where did Christ or the apostles ever
openly condemn U. They were 'uttor'j si
lent ;' was U not therefore sinful?

SPEECHES AT THE ANNIVERSARY.
Pursuant to the notice (riven last week, we pro
ceed to publish the speeches delivered at the late
Anniversary meeting ; that of Mr. Lee, from a copy
fiirmshorl hv himself, and the others from the re
porters of the New York Observer and Evangelist,
correcting each by the other, and by our own brief
notes.
GERItIT SMITH.
Gerrit Smith, Lsq. ot Peterborough, IN. i ., in
moving the acceptance and printing of the report,
expressed his hope that when printed, the report,
with all the important statements and convincing
arguments it coniained, might reach, every portion
of our country. God, he said, would bless these
truths, and would give them efficacy on the minds
of men, in spite of the spurious religion and spuri
ous republicanism which curse our land.
MR. iuskin. ; .
Rev. John Rankin, of Ohio, seconded the mo
tion. He said he had been brought"" tip in the
midst of slavery, and now lives on the borders of a
Free State, where he was every hour looking over
upon the land of oppression. All my life, said he,
except seventeen years, has been spent in the slave
States, and no person has more kindly feelings to
wards the slaveholding States than myself. There
my friends and kindred dwell. I speak the lan
guage of kindness, and would do the utmost in
tny power to persuade them to put away an evil
which threatens their destruction. I must say 1
rejoice in the triumph, of the principles of imme
pnni
diate emancipation, because
I know, from lone
observation, it is tuc only tiling that can relieve
both master and slave from inevitable ruin. The
system of slaveholding is calculated to bring ruin
upon the country where it is tolerated ; and 1
speak the language of the South, when they speak
candidly. . I was a member of an Anti-Slavery So-cu-ty
in Kentucky, Iweiily years ago, on the same
princple as this. The doctrine of immediate
emancipation i3 said to be new; but societies were
formed all over the country, twenty years ago, and
many members advocated the same doctrine. The
slaveholders confessed that it was a ostein that
would bring ruin upon the country ; but when
asked whv thev did not abolish it, they would
say, like llczckiah of old, "" it will not come now
we shall have peace in our day."" Others said
they believed, with the assistance of the free Sta'cs.
they could hoW them forever. Vet we aie told,
thefrce States have nothing to do with the subject.
Slaveholders have told me, if separated from the
free States, they would be in the hands of the
slaves entirely.
We feel the hand of oppression not only upon
llie slave, but upon ourselves.- Where I live, my
soul is harrowed continually with the cruelties
committed in sight of my house, where slavery ex
ists in its mildest form. There, slavery has some
times caused our town to go in mourning. Here,
lio related the case of a slave ferryman, who was
suddenly and without warning or preparation, sold
for $750, by his master, to go "" down the river,"" af
ter having agreed to set him free, and the money
had been raised for the purpose, because an oppor
tunity of getting $200 more, so that he was sep
arated from his wife and children. The details
of the case have been already published. While
I continue to be a husband and a father I must
stand up and protest against this evil.
Laws have been passed in Ohio, imposing a
fine of $500, or imprisonment, on any person who
shall knowingly assist a slave to escape. There
was an aged mother who had been brought up in the
Presbyterian church, and who sustained an unblem
ished Christian character for twenty years, who fell
into the hands of heirs, who, it is said, wished to lib
erate her, but the guardians were determined to sell
her, old as she was, into the cruel slavery of the
South. She was obliged to fly. Now suppose
this sister in the church had come to me, and I
had assisted her to flee from her cruel persecutors,
the State would have fined me $500 or sent me
to prison. Yet, I, as a minister of Christ, should
only have been doing what U enjoined by the gos
pel I preach. I am forbidden to do an act of char
ity I am commanded to do the very hing which
the Bible forbids mo to doto deliver the fugitive
servant to his master. I should be bound to take
this sister into my house if she comes there ; and
yet such is the effrontery of slavery, that they have
come over and demanded that we, who assist our
brethren, according to the requisitions of God's
word, shall suffer bonds and imprisonment. I can
not, therefore, but rejoice in the success of this
Society ; and it shall have my prayers day and
night.
KEV. LUTHER LEE's SPEECH.
"" Resolved, That the system of American sin
Very usurps the prerogatives of God, tends to blot
the divine image from the soul of man, degrades
Jiim from the dignified rank his Maker gave him
in the scale of creation, and subverts all the so
cial relations which God and nature have made
essential in his earthlv allotment.""
Mr. President, were I to attempt to give a brief
but comprehensive view of the sinfulness ot sla-
very, I would do it in the words of St. Paul to
Bar-Jesus, ' Thou full of all subtlety and mischief,
thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all right
eousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right
ways of the Lord V and then I would answer the
question in a thrilling and emphatic INU, mat
would make every heart feel that slavery, bad as
it is, can be made no better. I have it not in my
heart so much to undervalue the intelligence, mor
al sense and humanity of this assembly, as to
suppose that they are pro-slavery in judgment,
n heart, and in feeling, yet as there is a vast dif
ference between believing that slavery is wrong,
and seeing and feeling how great a wrong it is, 1
trust it will not be considered a breach of charity
to suppose that there may he many, now within
the sound of my voice, who have never consider
ed the masrnitude of this great sin. I wish then
to be understood as not making the present effort,
so much to convince you that slavery is wrong, as
to cause you to see and feel the greatness of the
wrong, that in its guilt it rises to heaven, and in
jts corruption It sinks to hell,
The resolution which I have had the honor of
presenting, lays four distinct crimes to the charge
of slavery, which I will attempt briefly to sustain.
i. ine resolution charges slavery with usurp
ing the prerogatives of God. To be convinced of
this, I need only compare the requisition which
uod makes upon Ins creatures with the assump'
lions of slavery. The divine requisition is sum
med up in the first and great commandment, in
these words: ' lliou shalt love the Lord thy God
with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with
all thy mind, and with all thy might.' Now,
nothing can be plainer than that slavery usurps
what God has here reserved to himself, when it
says : ' A slave is one who is in the power ot a
master, to whom he belongs. The master may
sell him, dispose of his person, his industry and
his labor : lie can do nothing, possess nothing, nor
acquire any Hung but what must belong to his
master."" ljnvmana Lint Lode, art. 6o. Here
it is seen that slavery sets up a claim to man which
contravenes the claim of God, it seizes upon the
subjects of God's moral government, and wrests
them from Ins administration, and subjects them
to the will of n despot, who is not satisfied with
trampling upon the rights of man, but who arro
gantly attempts to wrest the reins of government
from him whose throne is in the heavens. Ihe
claim of slavery equals the claim of God, it claims
the whole man, and asserts its absolute right to
the whole soul and body, mind and muscle, all
that the man is, all that he can do, all he can pos
sess, and all that. he can acquire, and what more
than this can God claim ? Have these human
hattels souls that must be forever saved or lost?
and can they do nothing in the work of saving or
damning their souls, but what must belong to their
masters ? Suppose they obey God, so far as cir
cumstances will permit, and through Jesus Christ
acquire eternal life, will that belong to the master ?
and will he appear at the judgment seat and claim
the crown by virtue of his title to the slave, who
' can do nothing, possess nothing, nor acquire any
thing but what must belong to his master V Or
suppose the slave to be as wicked as his master,
and 10 live and die a child of the devil, and an
leir of hell, will the master appear and take the
f 1 fi t . I '1.1.
nacres oi sin as ins own : n may oe saici mat
nothing is meant more than that slaves can do,
possess and acquire nothing of a temporal nature
but what must belong to their masters. I know
this is what is meant, but I know with equal cer
tainty, that man's future destiny depends upon
what he does and possesses in this life. Christ
represents himself as saying at the last day, ' Come
ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom pre
pared for you from the foundation of the world,
for I was an hungered and ye gave me meat, na
ked and ye clothed me, sick and ye visited me, in
Erison and ye came unto me. Inasmuch as ye
ave done it unto one of the least of these my
brethren ye have done it unto me.' And again
he says, Depart ye cursed into everlasting fire, j
prepared for the devil and his angels, for I was an
hungered and ye gave nie no meat, I was thirsty,
and ve gave nie no drink, I was a stranger and
ve took me not in, naked and ve clothed me not,
sick and in prison and ye visited me not Verily
I say unto you, inasmuch as ye did it not to one
of Ihe least of these, ye did it not to me.""
Now, I ask, can those who can do nothing but
what must belong to another, visit the sick and
those in prison ? Can those who can possess noth
ing and acquire nothing but what must belong to
another, feed the hungry and clothe the naked ?
V ou all know they cannot, and hence you see that
slavery disqualifies men for subjects of God's
moral government, it denies them the means ol
complying with the first precepts of the gospel,
it therefore contravenes the claims ot Liod, and
sets at nought the great law of our being, which
holds all intelligent creatures in allegiance to the
throne of the Creator. If this is not high trea
son against the government of God, treason i3 a
nonentity. If it is not trespass upon the prerog
atives of God, it can never be proved that the dev
il has committed trespass in the case ol all the
souls he has seduced from their allegiance to the
divine throne, for he never claimed more of man
than slavery claims, and never received more from
the most accomplished and zealous nena mat ever
served his cause, disembodied or incarnate ; no,
not on the black throne of hell, wielding a scep
tre of unmingled despotism over unblessed ghosts
whose ruined immortality exerts its perverted en
ergies under cover of that dark night of despair
that mantles the damned. Mow great a sin is
slavery ? It is the sum of all sin, it is a monopo
ly of crime '. For a worm of earth, a man, to at
tempt to throw off his own allegiance to his Ma
ker is an awful thought ; but awful as it is, it is
as much below the crime of slavery, os he who
would simply expatriate himself from his govern
ment, is less chargeable with treason, than he,
who instead of expatriating himself, should at
tempt to expel his sovereign for the purpose of
seizing the throne himself. The common sin of
refusing to obey is outdone and lost in the blacker
shades of the slaveholder's guilt, who not only re
fuses to obey himself, but refuses to let others
obey, seizing upon the subjects of God's moral
government, and, usurper-like, attempts to reign
in the place of the Almighty. It must be seen
from this, that slavery usurps the prerogatives of
God, and that so far as slavery prevails, the gov
ernment of God is blotted from the world.
II. Slavery is charged in the resolution with
a tendency to blot the divine imago from the soul
of man.
So far as the image of God, in which man was
created, consisted in the rectitude of his character
as a moral leing, I shall not now discuss the sub
ject, for so far the divine image must be lost be
fore slavery could exist ; for none but fallen and
depraved beings would ever be found in the rela
tion of master and slave. To know what consti
tuted the image of God, in which man was made,
we ueod only inquire what distinguished him from
the lower creatures; for it appears to me that
whatever the image was, it distinguished man as
more emphatically the offspring of God, and con
stituted the difference between him and the brute
creation. What then distinguished man from the
brutes t
1. While brutes were made wholly of inferior
elements, with spirits that tend downward, man
claims affinity with the heavenly world, God hav
ing superadded to his earthly nature a living soul,
which he infused of his own immortal breath.
Now, it must be admitted that slavery can never,
in point of fact, blot this feature of the divine im
age from the soul of man, by making him any
thing but an immortal being; yet it overlooks his
immortality, and treats this undying spirit as tho'
it were mere matter, having no higher origin than
the earth, and looking forward to no higher .desli
n y than the brutes; that perish."" This immortal
being, this living soul, which God kindled in man
with the quenchless fires of his own immortality,
which is to return to its author to dwell with God
forever, to sing with nngels, and swell the loud
triumphs of heaven and the glories of the throne ;
or sink in endless perdition, as a fallen spirit un
worthy a higher sphere :- this being is made ""a
personal chattel to be bought and sold, is made an
instrument of gratification to the hell-born passions
of ambition and fust, is yoked with the brute, and
driven through life by the sting of the task mas
ter s lash like tho ox that perishes, as though
there were no heaven for the negro beyond the
delusive dream that intrudes itself upon his short
hours of slumbering repose, so soon disturbed by
the well known sound of the horn that summons
him to a renewal of his toils, and as though there
were no hell for him to shun beyond the limits of
the cotton-held, the sugar-planti tion or the rice
swamp.
While God created the brute animals with
nothing to rule their spirits and guide their ac
tions but the impulse of an instinctive nature, he
endowed man with the more noble faculty of
reason, and thus formed him nfier the model of
his own nature, who is the only being in the uni
verse possessing reason in absolute perfection.
Now it is too plain to need proof that slavery la
bors to keep the enslaved in ignorance, and even
tries to extinguish the lamp of reason with which
God lit up the soul of man. Slaveholders admit,
yea, contend that human beings cannot be held in
slavery without being also held in ignorance, and
hence no provision is made for the instruction of
slaves; yea, more, laws are enacted to prevent
their instruction under heavy penalties, and every
effort possible is made to shut out light and to
close every avenue to the soul, lest one enkindling
ray should lighten and ignite the dark spirits ol
the enslaved, lhus you see that slavery does all
it can to blot the image of God from the soul of
man, by degrading him, in point of intelligence,
as' nearly as may be, to a level with the brutes,
While the lettered master boasts of his knowledge,
pressing onward in the course of science and phi
losophy, until he makes the heavens the play
ground of his thoughts, and regales himself with
flowers plucked from the pathway of revolving
worlds, he imposes the blackest ignorance upon
the spirits he holds in bonds, suffering not one
beam of light to fall upon their rayless orbs ;
spirits by God himself made capable of constant
and endless improvement, destined to blaze and
shed their light upon the spheres of a cloudless
world, are by the very system ol slavery consigned
to a night of ignorance as black as the brow of
despair, and as perpetual as the roll of successive
generations.
III. The resolution charges slavery with the
crime of degrading man from the dignified rank
which his Maker gave him in the scale of crea
tion. God placed man over the work of his hands,
saying, ' let him have dominion over the fish of
the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the
cattle, and over all the earth.' This glory and
honor, with which God crowned his new-made
creature man, slavery plucks from his brow, it dis
mantles him of the authority which his Creator
gave him, and with its profane and heaven-provoking
hand, hurls him down from the sphere as
signed him by God himself, and gives him a
place among the brutes that perish. It should be
remarked that the authority with which God
crowned the first man, to subdue, rule, and possess
the world, belongs equally to all men, for it was
conferred equally upon all men in the person of a
common father. God hath made of one blood
all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the
ear'.h,' and it was when the blood of all men, the
blood of the whito and black man, flowed undis
tinguished in the veins of a common father, and
rushed through its arterial way at the pulsations
of the same undivided heart, that God bestowed
on him the right to possess and rule the world, and
hence, this right of possession and control belongs
equally to all men without distinction of color or
nation. This right is evidently wrested from man,
for the law of slavery declares that he can pos
sess nothing, which is so far from suffering him to
rule any part of the world, that it will not sutler
him to rule himself, no, not his own limbs, but
compels him to submit them to act as they are act
ed upon by the dictates of another's will. God
says, as much to the black man as to the white
man, 'Have dominion over the fish of the sea,
and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle
and over all the earth,' but slavery says, ' Not so,
Lord, he can do nothing, possess nothing, nor can
he acquire any thing but what must belong to his
master,' and which tells the truth, God or slavery,
I will leave you to judge.
IV. Slavery is charged in this resolution with
the crime of subverting all the social relations
which God and nature have rendered essential to
man's earthly allotment,
Man is a social being, his Maker formed him
for society and gave him a nature which claims re
ciprocal enjoyments from kindred spirits ; hence,
wherever man is found, he is known to exist in
some kind of society, and taste- though loo often
with a savage appetite, the sweets of friendly in
tercourse. God having created man to exist in a
social state, he has given us rules by which we
should be governed in our intercourse with each
other, but slavery!, tramples upon these rules, and
pours its full cup pfj wormwood and gall into the
very fountains of human society. I cannot par
ticularize, but will note one or two points as speci
mens of the whole.
1. Slavery annihilates the matrimonial institu
tion. This lies oi '! very foundation of society,
it is the fountain u In- !t ; nds out its living streams,
and fertilize this :U world with the buds and
flowers and rifli li trvi 't of social animation, This
inslltation Is the- oUk-si known to man, its plan was
laid by Gad himself when he declared, It is not
good that the man should be alone,' it was estab
lished when God,1 having formed a woman, bro'l
her to the man and presented a bride fair and in
uocent in the lietit ot the lirst morn, ana it was
first celebrated in Eden's undefiled bowers, ere de
pravity had corrupted the fountains of the heart, or
one blush ol guilt had reddened the countenance
serene. , And God,, having instituted matrimony,
Christ says, I-or this cause shall a man leave hi
father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his
wife, and they twain shall ba one flesh, therefore
those whom God hath joined together let not man
put asunder;' and yet slavery does this ; it lavs its
unholy hands upon the bridal pair & rends them as
under as though God had not joined them together.
But it may be a question with some whether there
is any such thing as matrimony among slaves. I
know there is not, there cannot be, so far as matri
mony is to be regarded as a legal contract, but are
.1 1 -I I r f, i . r. r i
uiey marneu in uie sigiu oi uou s do lar as this
argument is concerned, it matters not whether thev
are married or not, for I will take a position which
will make the argument good in either alternative
I say, then, they are married or they are not ; if
t'ley are married, then slavery parts those whom
God hath joined together ; and if they are not
married, then slavery annihilates the institution,
and so far as the three million of slaves are con
cerned, the entire south is one scene of corruption,
pollution and rottenness. Take which horn of the
dilemma you please, and the argument is (rood :
say that slaves are married, and you charge sla
very with parting husbands and wives, and of ma
king twain of those whom God has pronounced
one i or say that slaves arc not married, and you
charge slavery with the entire subversion of a di
vine institution. I repeat, take which horn of the
dilemma you please, cither will hang up slavery
to the contemptuous gaze of all who have pure
and virtuous eyes, and to be pierced by the liery
arrows of God Almighty's law.
2. Slavery annihilates the obligation growing
outol the relation subsisting between parents and
children. The command of God is, ' Children.
ooey your parents m the lord.and ye lathers, pro
voke not your children to wrath, but train them
up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.'
God says, Children obey your parents in the Lord,
but slavery says, No, not so, Lord, they must obey
their masters who own both parents and children.
and have the right of separating them forever by
selling the one at auction and the other by the
pound. 1 he son is robbed of all interest in his
sire out of whose loins he came, is denied all right
of obeying him during Jhe years of his minority,
or of assisting him in the riper years of his man
hood ; he cannot even reach out his hand to wipe
the tear from his grief-furrowed cheek, or to sup
port his faltering limbs as he is hastened down
life's declivity by the sting of the driver's lash.
1 he daughter has no right to obey her mother.
cannot administer to the comfort of her who in
anguish gave her being, cannot pour one drop of
consolation into that grief-charged bosom from
which she drew her first nutriment, and at which
she was nurtured and reared from helpless infan
cy to endure the woes of riper years.
Parents are also denied the right of responding
to the obligations due to their offspring. God
commands parents to ' train up their children in
the nurture and admonition of the Lord,' but sla
very says, No, parents, ye shall not train up your
children, or if you do, it shall not be for yourselves
nor for the Lord, but for me, that I may sacrifice
your sons on the altar of my avarice, and your
daughters upon the altar of my lust.
Thus you see that the resolution is true to the
very letter: Slavery usurps the prerogatives of
God, tends to blot the divine image from the soul
of man, degrades him from the dignified rank his
Maker gave him in the scale of creation, and sub
verts all the social relations which God and nature
have rendered essential to his earthly allotment.
But though I think I have sustained the resolution,
yet I feel that I have come far short of giving a
""full view of the sinfulness and horrors of slavery :
I have only discovered to you the points of the
serpent's forked tongue ; the body of the viper, in
hideous form, still lies concealed and i known in
the ever-abiding miseries, and dark horrors of the
cotton field, the sugar plantation, and the rice
swamp, from which I have not attempted to draw
the veil, Let no one think that I have given an
exaggerated view of the subject; exaggeration is
impossible, the reality transcends the power of fic
tion, and every nttemptnt declamation lessens the
sublime horror of slavery. To describe it would
require words that should, at the same time, shriek
with terrors of death, shade with the night of des
pair, and glow with the fires of hell. Q could I
wake the winds of the south, and cause them to
pour into the ears of this assembly, the sighs and
groans and shrieks of tortured fathers, and tortur
ed mothers, and tortured sons, and tortured daugh
ters, I should need no other argument, for such
sighs and groans and shrieks, coming up from the
dark land of slavery, and concentrating at this
point, would howl in the ears of the assembly in
notes as wild as the cheer of assembled ghosts.
But I must forbear, or my indignant soul will sub
stitute execration for argument, whereas Michael,
when contending with the devil, brought not a
railing accusation against him, but said, The Lord
rebuke thee ; and may the Lord rebuke slavery :
rebuke it as Christ rebuked intruding devils, with
a rebuke that sent them back in scampering haste
to their native hells, and may it not, like the eject
ed legion, be permitted to enter into the swine, but
be driven naked and unattended down the gulf of
everlasting chaos and oblivion, never more to lilt
its serpentine head this side of the bourne that di
vldes this from the world of wo. Let it be blotted
from the polluted records of the church, let it lie
blotted from the disgraced annals of the State and
Nation, ic if it must have an enduring pnjjc assign
ed it on which to write its dark crimes, let it be
in tho biography of some damned ghost, or in the
history ot Beelzebub the prince of (he devils, ,

Unprecedented Literary Baseness.
The character of a man of letters belongs to his
country and to mankind. We are not among tW
devotees ol that department of literature to which
our present secretary of the Navy has been chiefly
devoted. But his claims to be considered one of
the literati of our country must be questioned.
The number and popularity of his writings, and
especially the fact thai Messers. ""Harpers are now
engaged in publishing a uniform edition of his
works, more voluminous, probably, than those of
any living writer among us, establish his standing.
and give to the American peoplea more than ordi
nary interest in any charge of literary delinquency
which may be brought against them. It is. mor-

small degree, to his literary reputation for his pres

in regard to a bare-laced and literary lraud, in
which Mr. Paulding has allowed himself to be en-
gaged, for the purpose of securing slavery from
the rising tide ol reprobation r We do not know of
a case that is parallel to it, And taking it en all
bearings, we must say, it aflbrds at least colorable
for the stinging interrogatory with which our ex
tract closes. Has it come to this? What new
sacrifices will Moloch exact, when it has constrain
ed Paulding to lay on its bloody altar his literary
integrity ? Are there to be no limits to our nation
al degradation ? We fully believe the idol him
self to be as insatiable as Juggernaut, and that he
will go on increasing in his exactions, unless the
public mind can be roused to throw off the scrvilo
yoke,
J. lv. i'aulding, the present Seretary of the-
Navy, gives us the following picture of a scene ho
witnessed in Virginia

horse, in which five or six half naked black chil
dren were tumbled in like pigs together. The
cart had no covering, and they semed to have been
actually broiled to sleep. Behind the cart march-
d three black women, with heads, necks and
breasts, uncovered, and without shoes or stockings ;
next came three men, bear-headed, half naked, and
chained together with an ox chain. Last of all,
came a white man a white man, Frank! on
horseback, carrying pistols in his belt, and who,
as we passed them, had impudence enough to look
us in the face without blushing. I should like?
to have seen him hunted by blood-hounds, At '

as the Missouri Compromise law, by which

now l;nown as Kansas and Nebraska was for

f.istly. though ineffectually, opposed
alarming and dangerous act.
You need not be told that the slavery i
liiHstion lies nt the bottom of it. As it was!
;ho slaveholding power that demanded the
nactment of the Missouri Compromise, so
it is the same power that has now demanded
its abrogation.
African slavery was regarded and de
nounced as a great evil by the American
colonies, even before the revolution ; and
those colonies which are now slaveholding
States, were equally earnest in such remon-
st ranees with those which are now free,
states. Colonial laws, lramed to prevent
the increase of slavery, were vetoed by the
King of Great Britain. This exercise of ar
bitrary power to enlarge and perpetuate a
ystein universally regarded as equally
wrongful in itself and injurious to the colo
nies, was one of the causes of the revolu
tion. When the war was ended there was an
imperious necessity for the institution of
some government in the then unoccupied
enitories of the United States. In 1784,
Jefferson proposed, and in 17S7 the Conti
nental Congress adopted the ordinance for the
government of the territory lying northwest
of the Ohio, by which it was declared that
'here thall be neither slavery nor involuntary
servitude except for the punishment of
crime. The great and flourishing States
since organized within that territory, on the
basis of that ordinance, are enduring mon
uments of the wisdom of the statesmen of
the revolution.
The foreign slave trade was regarded as
the source of American slavery, which it
was believed would be dried up, when that
fountain should be closed. In adopting the
Constitution, it was 60 universally antici
pated that the foreign slave trade would be
promptly prohibited, that all parties acqui
esced in astipulation postponing that meas
ure till 1808. The foreign slave trade was
prohibited thus the source of slavery was
understood to be dried up, while the intro
duction of slavery into the territories was
prohibited. The slavery question, so far as
it was a national one, was understood to be
finally settled, and at the same time the States
had already taken up and were carrying for
ward a system of gradual emancipation.
In 1803, Louisiana was acquired by purchase
from France, and included what is known
as the States of Louisiana, Missouri, Arkan
sas and Iowa, and the territories known as
Kansas and Nebraska Slavery existed at
the time in New Orleans and at St. Louis,
and so this purchase resulted in bringing the
slavery question again before Congress. In
1812, the region immediately surrounding
New Orleans applied for admission into the

Union, under the name of the State of Lou
isiana, with a constitution tolerating slave
ry, and the free States acquiesced. Eight
years afterward the region connected with
St. Louis demanded admission under the
name of the State of Missouri, with a con
stitution tolerating slavery. The free States
reverted to the principle of 1787, and op
posed the admission of Missouri, unless she
would incorporate into her constitution an
inhibition of the further introduction of
slavery into the State. The slaveholding
States insisted upon her unqualified ad
mission. A controversy arose which was
sectional and embittered, and which, we are
assured by contemporaneous history seriously
imperilled the Union. The statesmen of
that day in Congress settled the controversy
by compromise. By the terms of this com
promise the free States assented to the ad
mission of Missouri with her slaveholding
constitution, while the slaveholding States
on their part yielded the exclusion of slavery
in all the residue of the territory which lay
north of 36 deg. 30 min., constituting tire
present territory of Kansas and Nebraska.
The slaveholding States accepted the com-
promise as a triumpti, ana trie tree states
have ever since left it undisturbed and un-
questioned. Arkansas, a part of the terri-
tory of Louisiana, which lay south of 36
deg. 30 min., in compliance with an impli
;my cation which was contained in this compro
six Nojmise, was afterwards admitted as a slave
State, holding State, and the. frpp. States arnni-
'esced. ' !

was annexed, with a provision in the article
of annexation for the sub-division of her
territory into five States. The free States,
although they regarded the annexation, with
the probable increase of the number of slave
states, with very great disfavor, nevertheless
acquiesced again. New territories were ac
quired by the treaty of peace which closed
the war with Mexico. The people of Cali
fornia formed a constitution prohibiting
slavery, and applied for admission into the
Union. Violent opposition was made by
the slave states in and out of Congress.
threatening the dissolution of the Union if
Oalilornia should be admitted. Proceeding
on the ground of these alarms, Congress
adopted another compromise, the terms of
which were, that ten millions of dollars of
the people's money should be given to Tex
as to induce her to relinquish a very doubt
ful claim upon an inconsiderable part of
New Mexico, that New Mexico and Utah
should be organized without an inhibition
of slavery, and that they should be after
wards admitted as slave or free States as the
people, when forming constitutions, should
determine ; that the public slave trade in
the District of Columbia should be abolished
without effecting the existence of slavery in
the district ; and that new and rigorous pro
visions for the re-capture of fugitive slaves,
of disputed constitutionality, should be
adopted, and that on these conditions Cali-
fornia should be admitted as a free State
Repugnant as this compromise was to the
people of the free states, acquiescence was
nevertheless practically obtained by means
of solemn assurances, made on behalf of the
slaveholding States, that the compromise
was and should be forever regarded as a final
adjustment of the slavery question, and of
all the issues which could possibly arise out
of it. Anew Congress convened in Decem
ber 1851. Representatives from the slave
states demanded a renewed pledge of fidelity
to this adjustment. It was granted by the
House of Representatives on the following
terms :
Resolved, ""That we recognize the binding
efficacy of the compromises of the constitu
tion, and believed it to be the intention of
the people generally, as we hereby declare it
to be ours individually, to abide by such com
promises and sustain the laws necessary to
carry them out, the provisions for the deliv
ery of fugitive Blaves, and the act of the last
Congress for that purpose included ; and that
we deprecate all further agitation of ques
tions embraced in the acts of the last Con
gress, known as the compromise, and of
questions generally connected with the in
stitution of slavery, as unnecessary, useless
and dangerous.""
A few months subsequently, the Demo
cratic National Convention met at Balti
more, arid assuming to speak the sentiments
of the Democratic party, set forth in its
platform : That the Democratic party will
resist all attempt at renewing, in Congress or
out of it, the agitation of the slavery ques
tion under whatever shape or color the at
tempt may be made. Soon afterward anoth
er national convention assembled in the
same city, and assuming the right to declare
the sentiments of the Whig party, said :
"" We deprecate all further agitation of the
questions thus settled as dangerous to our
peace, and will discountenance all efforts to
continue or renew such agitation, whenever
or however made."" The present administra
tion was elected on the principle of adher
ence to this compromise, and the President,
refering to it in his inaugural speech, de
clared that the harmony which had been se
cured by it should not be disturbed during
his term of' office. The President, recurring
to the same subject, renewed his pledge in
his message to Congress at the beginning of
the present session, in the following lan
guage :
"" But notwithstanding differences of opin
ion and sentiments which then existed in
relation to details and specific provisions,
the acquiescence of distinguished citizens
whose devotion to the Union can never be
doubted, has given renewed vigor to our in
stitutions, and restored a sense of repose and
security to the public mind throughout the
confederacy. That this repose shall suffer
no shock during my official term, if I have
the power to avert it. those who placed me
here may be assured.""
Under these circumstances, the proposi
tion to repeal the Missouri Compromise was
suddenly and unexpectedly made, by the
same committee on Territories, which only
ten days before had affirmed the sanctity of
the Missouri Compromise, and declared the
end of agitation in the following explicit
and unmistakeable language.
""Y'our committee do not feel themselves
called upon to enter into a discussion of
those controverted questions. They involve
the same grave issues which produced the
agitation, the sectional strife and the fearful
struggle of 1850. As Congress deemed it
wise and prudent to refrain from deciding
the matters in controversy then, either by
affirming or repealing the Mexican laws, or
by an act declaratory of the true intent of
the constitution, and the extent of the pro
tection afforded by it to slave property in
the territories, so your committee are not
prepared now to recommend a departure
from the course pursued upon that memora
ble occasion, either by affirming or repealing
the eighth section of the Missouri act, or by
any act declaratory of the meaning of the
constitution in respect to the legal points in
dispute.""
The abrogation has been effected in pur
suance of the demand of the administration
itself, and by means of its influence in Con
gress. In the House of Representatives, that
body which is more immediately responsible
to the people, the contest was more equal
than in the Senate; though it is due to jus
tice and candor that it should be stated, that
it could not have been carried in either house
without the votes of the representatives from
the free states. The minority resisted the
attempts to arrest discussion upon this grave
question, through a struggle of longer dura
tion than any other known to Congressional
history. Some attempt was made to stig
matize that minority as "" factionists,"" yet
we fearlessly declare that throughout the
contest they resorted solely to the powers
secured to them by the law and the rules of
the House, and the passage of the measure
through the House was effected through a
supervision of its rules by the majority,
and the exercise of a power unprecedented
in the annals of Congressional legisla
tion. The deed is done. It is done with
clear proclamation by the administra
tion and by Congress, that the principle
which it contains extends not only to Kan
sas and Nebraska, but to all the other terri
tories now belonging to the United States,
and to all which may hereafter be acquired.
It has been done unnecessarily and wanton
ly, because there way no pressure for the
i-eurasita,
organization of governments in Kansas and
TTl. i ?.i u;t . .
neuner oi wmcn territories con
tains one lawful inhabitant who was a citi
zen of the United States, and because there
was not only no danger of disunion appre
hended, but by this reckless measure the iree
States have lost all the guarantee for freedom
in the territories contained in former com
promises, while all theStates, both slave and
free, have lost the guarantees of harrnony
and union which these compromises afforded.
It seems plain to us that, fatal as the meas
ure it in these respects, it is only a cover for
broader propagandisni of slavery in the
future, The object of the administration,
and of many who represent the stave States
is, as we believe, to prepare the way for an
nexing Cuba at whatever cost, anil a like
annexation of half a dozen of the States ot""
Mexico, to be admitted also as slave States
The acquisitions are to be made peaceablv
it tney can oe purcnasea at tne cost oi hun
dreds of millions. If they cannot be made
peacefully, then at the cost of a war with
Mexico, and a war wih Spain, and a war
with France, and at the cost of an alliance
with Russia scarcely less repugnant. Unmis
takeable indications also appear of a pur
pose to annex the eastern part of St. Domin
go, and to subjugate the whole island, restor
ing it to the dominion ot slavery and this
is to be followed up by an alliance with
Brazil, and the extension of slavery in the
valley of the Amazon. It is for you to judge
whether, when slavery shall have made these
additions to the United States, it will de
mand unconditional submission on the part
of the free states, and failingin that demand,
attempt a withdrawal of the slave States
and the organization of a separate empire in
the central region of the continent. From
an act so unjust and wrongful in itself and
fraught with consequences so fearful, we
appeal to the people. We appeal in no sec
tional spirit. We appeal equally to the
North and to the South, to the free States and
to the slaveholding States themselves. It is
no time for exaggeration or for passion. an:l
we therefore speak calmly of the past, and
warn you in sober seriousness of the future.
It would not become us, nor is it necesr
sary, to suggest the measures which ought
to be adopted in this great emergency.
For ourselves we are ready to do all that
shall be in our power to restore the Mis
souri Compromise, and to execute such
further measures as you in your wisdom shall
command, and as may be necessary for the.
recovery of the ground lost to freedom, and
to prevent the further aggressions of slaverv.

The Death of a Social System
By S. Macaulay
In his book, ""The Economic Consequences of
the Peace,"" J. M. Keynes, at one time a represent
ative of the British Treasury at the Paris Peace
Conference, has the following passage:
""In continental Europe the earth heaves and
no one but is aware of the rumblings. There
it is not just a matter of extravagance or
""labor troubles""; but of life and death, of
starvation and existence, and of the fearful
convulsions of a dying civilization ""
There is a possimistic note in Mr. Keynes' writ
ing which is perhaps natural to one who has not
experienced the keen pleasure of arriving at the
solution of the riddles and paradoxes presented by
the economic chaos of Europe.
Mr. Keynes may have heard of Marx, but he
says nothing in his book to indicate that he has
considered the application of Marx's theories. The
remedies he proposes are of the usual type put for
ward by the bourgeoisie, and futile.
In one point, however, Mr Keynes is in
agreement with Marx; he speaks of the death of""
a civilization. Socialists have pointed out, have
been pointing out for the last half century, that
social systems have no permanency, that they rise
and fall with the changes produced by the improve
ment in the methods of production. The case in
point is hardly the death of a Civilization; it is
the demise of a social system, and the demise is
closely connected with the birth of a new system.
I propose, therefore, to substitute the expres
sion ""social system"" for the world Civilization.
The History Of Class Struggles.
The history of the human race has been a
history of class struggles, the manifestations of
which have been different in different countries,
and under different economic conditions. But there
has (since the institution of chattel slavery) al
ways been the confliction of interests upon which
the class struggle is based.
Assyrian, Chaldean, Egyptian, Greek, Roman,
Aztec economic history all present the same spec
tacle of rise and fall. What is the canker that lay at
the root of them all, that lies at the root of the
present system? What is the common factor of
unsoundness?,
It is SLAVERY. The enslavement of one class
by another.
But why, it will be asked, should slavery be a
disintegrating force? Is it not true that thousands
of slaves were not only contented, but happy as
slaves? It is perfectly true. The position of the
chattel slave of the old days was infinitely better
than that of the industrial slave of today; his
master was also his owner, he had a personal in
terest in keeping him in good repair, the.slave was
an investment of so much money, and so must be
looked after. But the slavery of the wage-worker
is a different type; it is a concealed slavery; it
has the appearance of freedom; the slave is not
bound to one master, he is the slave of a CLASS,
he belongs to a slave CLASS.
The industrial slave of today is driven at a
rate unknown in the days of chattel slavery; the
cut-throat competition for markets compels an in
tensification of exploitation Which makes the life
of the chattel slave appear a holiday in compari
son. It is this very intensification which is at the
root of the ""industrial unrest"" which is making
itself manifest in all capitalistically developed
countries. Consciously or unconsciously, the slaves
are' beginning to feel the gall-sores. They are be
coming class-conscious. In most cases they ,are in
utter darkness as to both the disease and the re
medy, and it was not until Marx exposed the dis
ease that the remedy was also made plain.
""Concessions"" To The Workers.
During recent jears the various Government s
have been frantically making concessions to the
workers. Unemployed insurance, old age pen-
-i!i, profit sharing, etc. etc., hayc boon the
sops thrown to the ""animals"" to pacify them.
But. they refuse to be pacified. Distrust of Gov
ern me i it. ami Parliament, National Assemblies
and Cabinets is oxmly expressed, and in some
cases they have been overthrown. Disgust at
the futility of ""parliamentary action"" is plain
ly manifested in the strikes and resorts to in
dustrial mas-s action which are prevalent.

The Program of Industrial Slavery
By Emil Lyons.
The capitalists of the United States, organized
in tlic National Chamber of Commerce, evidently
meant business when they adopted their program
of industrial slavery.
This program, winch calls for the open shop,
as many hours work as the workers can stand
and wages that will just keep- them and their
families alive, was submitted to a referendum
vote of all the local Chambers of Commerce in
the United States and adopted by an all but un
animous vote. That means that it has the solid
backing of the whole employed class. No doubt
there is an understanding tHat the capitalists will
stand by each other when they get in a fight on
account of this program.
That the bosses are acting upon this program
is shown by the issues which have developed in
recent strikes. There has been a stiffening of the
backbone on the part of the employers, and in
place of following the policy of compromising and
coming to an agreement at the earliest possible
moment after the development of a strike, they
arc standing like a stone wall against any com
promise on any of the essential points of their
program to enforce industrial slavery.
Fight on in C leveland.
This is indicated very clearly in two strikes
which are underway in Cleveland. The pattern
makers have been out for about four weeks and
the journeymen tailors have just gone out. Both
these organizations have had things pretty much
their own way in their industry in recent years.
They are both stronj? craft union which have
enforced the closed shop, and wage increases
whenever they have made a stand. Now they sud
denly find themselves up against a fight against
the open shop. Evidently the National Chamber of
Commerce program is being put into effect.
These strikes and other of a similar character
in other cities are but the first skirmishes in the
big battle which the united capitalist class if to
fight to put labor back in ts place. The period of
easy victories, whr.h the workers won through
out the war period ,is over. Unemployment is on
the increase. Hard times are on the way. With
the coming of the industrial crisis and growing
unemployment the conditions favorable to a vic
tory for the bosses are being created.
Plan to Reduce Wages.
If the bosr.es put over their program of in
dustrial slavery there will be a general reduction
of wages and the eight hour day will go into the
scrap heap. The good old days when the boss
hadn't the slightest hesitation of acting his part
of the czar to the limit will return.
How are the workers going to meet this pro
position? Aie they going into the battle against
the united bosses a few companies at a time, as
the patternmakers and journeymen tailors men
tioned above are doing, to the beaten piecemeal ?
Are they going to fight as crafts and have their
organizations smashed one at a time?
That is the kind of fight the bosses want. That
kind of fight makes victory certain for them.
If the workers are to beat the bosses program
of industrial slavery they will have to mobilize the
united power of the workers against the united
power of the bosses. The shop organization, shop
committee and industrial and community council
system will accomplish that.
The Way To Fight.
The way to begin the work of uniting the
workers is for the live workers in every shop to
get together and form a voluntary shop committee
for then- shop and begin agitation for a shop or
ganization and a shop committee elected by the
shop organization.
The shop committee of an industry should be
united in an industrial council in which sit dele
gates from every shop of the same industry in
any industrial centre and the industrial councils
for the various industries should be united in a
community council, in which sit delegates from
every industry in the community.
With such an industrial organization the work
ers can meet the united bosses and their program
of industrial slavery in a fight to the finish and
win.
The struggle is already underway. The time
for action is at hand. They way to act is to start
work in your shop to ORGANIZE A SHOP COMMITTEE.",PAGE 10,"[u'New York--New York--New York', u'Ohio--Cuyahoga--Cleveland']","Cleveland, Ohio",Communist Labor Party of Ohio,,10,1919,"[u'New York', u'Ohio']","[u'Cleveland (Ohio)--Newspapers.', u'Communism--United States--Newspapers.', u'Communism.--fast--(OCoLC)fst00870421', u'Labor movement--Newspapers.', u'Labor movement.--fast--(OCoLC)fst00990079', u'New York (N.Y.)--Newspapers.', u'New York (State)--New York.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204333', u'Ohio--Cleveland.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01205966', u'United States.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204155']",The toiler.,toiler.,page,http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88078683/1920-09-10/ed-1/seq-10.json

THE FREEMAN.
From the N. Y. Tribune.
Willis Hall's Letter.
To the Clat Whigs or the City of New York
The advice of friends and my own judgmen i
have at length prevailed over my reluctance t '
intrude myself upon the public, and induced m '
to address a word of explanation to those wit1
whom I have so long acted and with whom I s
entirely sympathize.
In uniting with the recent movement to rais
once more the name of our cherished leader, pro
hibited by no obligation expressed or implied,
followed the dictates of my feelings and my judg
merit. I vns convinced that it was the last ant
n-i'y :n ..is left, to preserve the principles of thai
p , y, endeared to me by all my political recol
h;;u,is If the old standard with its inottos and
cmblazjiimeuts could be; kept flying, there might
be a rallying point for the party after this tern
porary madness is passed.
For this course I have been expostulated with
by friends in the language of friendship, for which
I return them many thanks. I have also beer
abused, my motives impugned, and my acts mis
represented by those who have hitherto been no
torious for the absence of all principle, public 01
private; who have distinguished themselves by
their noisy zeal for Mr. Clay while their hearti
were bursting with rancor against ""him and his
adherents. Within the last year they revel in
their freedom from restraint; and pour forth
their pent-up venom with redoubled energy upon
the man whom even his generous enemies be
hold with admiration and respect. To be em
balmed in the abuse of those who have abused
him is an honor to which I could not have as-,
pired.
But neither the expostulations of misguided
friends nor the abuse of common libellers had
a particle of influence in driving me fi-mithfi
course which I had deliberately and conscien
tiously adopted. No one but Mr. Clay himseli
could have arrested the movement. It was sup
posed that he would decline accepting a nomina
tion for that we were prepared and fully inten
ded to proceed upon our own responsibility, but
we were not prepared for an appeal to us, as his
personal friends, not to use his name. Venera
ting the man above all living men accustomed
to obey his slightest wishes the appeal was un
answerable. However, painfully mortifying, his
friends, myself among the number, were con
strained to abandon our purpose, and that noble
old standard which had been thrown to the breeze
was furled for the last time.
From that moment the Whig Party has ceased
to exist. Its name will continue to be used for
a short time to cajole those who are governed by
sound without meaning ; but its principles are
abandoned; openly denounced as impracticable
and obsolete by those who have been nvist noisy
in their vindication.
It was a glorious party. With it commenced
my political existence ; with it, it will end. To
it I have given the best years of my life ; to it I
have sacrificed my health ; my attachment to it
was too instinctively strong to be deceived.
The child might more easily be cheated into
believing the thieving Gipsey to be its mother
than a true whig from the start, be made to re
cognize his warm and living party in the lifeless,
soundless substitute sought to be palmed upon
him.
It was a glorious party! Its members wtre
not collected like vultures by the carrion scent
ef prey not bandits united by a partnership in
plunder, but, disinterested and patriotic it was
a blight emanation from a free, intelligent and
virtuous people. It had for its leader the man of
the Age. Born among the people, his sympa
thies were with them, a Democrat in heart and
soul. Rocked in the severest storms of the Re
public, he had become bold in her defence and
experienced in her guidance. Sincere in his
faith, ardent in his 'attachment to popular gov
ernment, inflexible in his honesty, unecpialed in
his far-reaching sagacity, in the rapidity and com
prehensive wisdom of his conclusions, he stood
forth as the Model of a Republican Statesman.
No superior has gone before, him, no equal will
follow. This man was murdered in the house of
his friends. His assassins are known, and his
tory is preparing to gibbet these Ravaillacs in
the c'i .ins which they have forged for them
seV?j. B :i i ie Whig party is no more.
' Vis world is all before me, where to choose,
A i ! Providence my guide.""
W.i i the vessel in which I embarked is driv
e.i upon the rocks by the winds of heaven, or by
the barratrous act of the master, it is but the
instinct of self preservation to bind myself to the
largest fragment of the wreck. That wreck is
FREE SOIL. To that I will cling till death
shall loosen my grasp.
The non-extension of Slavery has long been a
favorite doctrine with the Whigs of this State,
and it so happens that it is the only one of their
issues likely to be discussed or of any practical
importance during the next Presidential term.
It is said by the Cass and Taylor men who
pretend to be in favor of Free Soil that no far
ther legislation on the subject is necessary that
slaves on being taken to Free Soil become free
of course. It is probably so ; but it is enough
for me, without entering into any discussion as
to the truth of this proposition, that Mr. Calhoun
and the ultra slaveholders of the South deny this
doctrine. It is therefore proper, if for no other
reason, to have a public expression of the Na
tion's will on this important point.
The most respectable authorities tell me, also
that ""Free Soil is all a humbug that slaves
would never be taken to California or New Mex
ico. I beg leave to dilTer with these gentlemen.
Admitting for a moment the truth of their asser
tion, is the principle nothing T
It waa thought important to exclude Slavery
from Oregon, although there was Jittlo or no
danger of Slavery's being introduced there. The
question is as to the adoption of a general rule.
To-day its application may be very immaterial ;
to morrow it may be vitally important. It ha
been adopted in the case of Oregon ; shall we
now abandon it ? Annexation and Slavery go
hand in hand. If we annex Slavery with terri
tory, we shall absorb all South America. Ke
fuse to extend Slavery, and the rage for Annex
ation ceases.
But the fact asserted is denied. Slavery will
be introduced, if permitted, into various part of
California and New Mexiao. Slaves were first
employed on this Continent in the mines of
South America. I his species of labor, requiring
strength without intellect, is one to which Slaves
are eminently adapted.
The extension of Slavery is not a humbug, but
of great and immediate practical importance. It
will be decided within 1 lie next four years: there
is no tune to sleep upon it. Unle tne real
friends of Free Soil exert themselves, it will he
decided against them. This Free Sail doctrine
is perfectly distinct from Abolition. That, as 1
understand it, seeks to coerce the abolition of
Slavery in the States now formed. This is in
manifest violation of their rights, and in contra
vention of the spirit of the agreement we have
made with them. Abolition is also a moral ques
tion, like temperance, the observance of the
Sabbath, and many similar questions ; however
much I may approve of tlmrri, -1 am utterly op
posed to their being brought to the ballot-box.
The political questions which must be decided
by the ballot are sufficiently complicated. If to
these be added the moral and religious questions
which will arise, it is evident that the ballot
must be abandoned, and popular government be
come impossible.
But the extension of Slavery is eminently a
political question, proper for political action and
discussion. South Carolina and Vermont con
tain the same number of white inhabitants; but
the first is represented by ninb members of Con
gress, while Vermont with even a greater num
ber of actual voters, has but nvE. This extra
ordinary illustration of the Democratic equality
which we boast is said to be the necessary con
sequence of the compromise of the Constitution.
Shall the Compromises which produce such mon
strous results be extended beyond what waa nrig
inally contemplated or intended 1 This in the
substance of the question ol the extension ot""
Slavery, and has always been discussed as a po
litical question since the foundation of the gov
ernment. But I am told I can best prevent the
Exlension of Slavery by voting for Gen Taylor
Why 1 is he opposed to it? No; but he will not
veto it. Perhaps so. But he distinctly refuse?:
to say whether ho will or not. Past all question
he is opposed to Free Soil, and will use all his
power and patronage against it. His neighbors
in the Soutii, who see him in his undress, say that
they know he is with them on this question.
His friends at the North practically admit it by
bounding their hopes by the empty fact that he
will not veto it. He has recently invested $190,
000 in slaves ; he has accepted the Charleston
nomination, made for the avowed purpose of op
posing it. The South made the Presidential
nomination to turn upon this question, and he
was selected. The great Ratification Metting
hclu by his friends in Canal st. passed a resolu
tion expressly repudiating this doctrine.
Mr. Webster says if he thought Gen. Taylor
opposed to Frc::Soilhe would vote against li int.
On a candid examination of all the evidence, I
am compelled to the belief that he is opposed to
the doctrine of Free Soil, and will do all in his
power to defeat it. On Mr. Webster's authority,
those who come to the same conclusion must
vote against Gen. Taylor.
On this point, the opinion of all the other can
didates; Mr. Clay, Gen. Scott, Judge McLean,
were frankly and explicitly avowed. Why was
Gen. Taylor excused 1 The North or the South
is to be cheated. Which is the most likely to
be the victim 1 Friends of Free Soil, pause !
Your are about to be betrayed. When it is too
late you will find that you have elected the only
man who could kave defeated your favorite ob
ject. Hereafter you cannot justify yourself to
your consciences or your God without requiring
a more explicit declaration on this point from
Gen. Taylor.
But, expostulates my friend, 'You cannot vote
for Mr. Van Buren.' Why not, if he will best
effect the object which 1 have most at heart. I
am not a Brabantio, to ""refuse to serve God I o
cause the Devil bids me."" Were my prejudices
a hundred times stronger than they are against
Mr. Van Buren, I should vote for him, if con
vinced he would truly carry out the principle he
now professes. I have no reason to doubt it
His worst enemy cannot say he has not always
been true to his pledges. I have been educated
in the maxim ""Principles not men.""
For this reason I, cannot vote for Gen. Taylor,
for whom, as a military man, in which capacity
alone I have known him, I enteitain high ad
miration lor this reason I can vote for Mr. Van
Buren, whom I have always opposed and against
whom I have many prejudices.
As the representative of Free Trade, a military
organization, &,c. I opposed him, and would do
so again : as the representative ot Free Moil I
will sustain him. In our system the principle is
everything, the man nothing. The friends of
Free Soil have selected him in spite of himself
us the best man, under the circumstances, to cl
fect their great object. Shall I abandon the prin
ciple which I have long cherished because I
might have preferred some other man to repre
sent it 1 This would be indeed to preler men to
principles.
I am again told that it is useless, that Mr. Van
Buren cannot be elected perhaps so. If I hid
selected my candidate for Availability, I might
have prefered some other. But voting for Mr.
Van Buren is not therefore useless. It is mate
rial to the, ultimate success of the principle of
Free Sou, that its frieudsshould make the strong
est possible demonstration at this lime. If it is
feeble and limited it will be despised by the south
and ridiculed alike by the friends of Cass and of
1 aylor. If, on the other hand, it now shows an
imposing front if its lion roar is heard through
the forest, the South will not dare to demand
that the new territories be admitted without re
striction, and if it does, neither the Cass nor the
Taylor party will dare to accede to their demand
Every vote strengthens the cause of Free Soil,
whether Mr. Van Buren is elected or not. Nine-
tentlis of the voters of the North are opposed to
the tarther Extension ot blavery, let but half that
number speak out like men, and their voice will
be as potential as the creative fiat ; but if deter
red by the cajolery of partizans, the senseless love
of success, a base hungering for spoils, or by any
other motive, let them hereafter lie down under
tha gibes and domination of Slavedom, nor dare
again to express a manly sentiment, which from
fear or folly, they are unable to carry into action.

lion. Wm. Blade's Letter.
READ AT THE BUFFALO CONVENTION.
Middle bury, Vt. July 29. 1848.
Hon. J. It. Giddings :
Dear Sir: Your letter, expressing a desiro that I
would attend the Free Soil Convntion, at Buffalo oa
the Uth ol August, has been received. I am sorry to
say that the duties connected with my present position
will necessarily prevent my attendance. 1 am entail
ed in an educational enterprise that occupies most of
my time, and abstracts my attention so much from the
political contests of the day that I cannot enter active
ly into them. I am, however, by no means indifferent
to what is passing. I have, with great solicitude,
watched the events of the last two months, and must
say, that they have awakened feelings that would
draw mo into the political arena, if other engagements
did not forbid it.
The present, it seems to me, very greatly exceeds
in interest and importance, any previous period in the
progress of the slave power in our country. The pre
tensions ofth.it power, and the means it is using tu u-c
complish its purposes, may well alirui thu friends of
freedom and of the Union; especially when looked at
in contrast with its pretensions, and position, when the
Constitution was established. Then, as evry body
acquainted with the history of that period knows, slav
ery was regarded as a doomed institution. Nobody
pretended to vindicate it, out of Georgia and South
Carolinia. In North Carolinia, Virginia, Maryland
and Delaware there was a strong and deep current of
feeling against it. No deeper tones of condemnation
were uttered nnywhero than in those States in all of
which, as well as throughout the north, its entire abo
lition, at no distant day, was desired and confidently
predicted. Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Mason,
Patrick Henry, Judge Iredell, Judge Chase, Luther
Martin, William Pinkney an numerous other leading
men of those States, were its open and decided oppos
ers.
The ordinance of '87, excluding? slavery from the
territory now forming the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illi
nois, Michigan and Wisconsin, was a hur exponent of
the spirit and principles of those times. It clearly
showed that it was the intention of the statesmen of
that period not to extend, but to restrict slavery. Thus
restricted and confined, it was the general expectation
that it was destined to speedy extinction. Its expect
ed fate was well described by a member of the Mass.
ratifying Convention in 1788, when he said ""Altho'
slavery is not smitten with an apoplexy, yet it has re
ceived its mortal wound, and will die of consumption.""
Such was the general sentiment of the country at that
period.
All this is confirmed by the cautious omission of any
word in tho Constitution, which would import to a
stranger even the existence of slavery in the country,
so odious was it, and so solicitous were the framers of
that constitution that its very name should be exclud
ed from that instrument.
Sixty years have elapsed, and what do we see5
In place of the 000,000 slaves in '87, we have ,'1,000,
000. Instead of six slave States, we have fifteen. In
stead of tho proportion of slave states to free, of six to
seven, we have a proportion of fifteen tojifleen. To ef
fect this increase of slave States, we have purchased
slave territory enough to make four; and to make a fifth,
have coljiiized with slavery a portion of the territory
of a neighboring nation, wrested it from that nation
and added.lt to our Union.
And finally, not satisfied with all this, we have wag
ed a war of conquest and slavery propagandism against
that nation, anil are now about to extend slavery over
more than 000,000 square miles of free territory wrest
ed from her in that wa-. Yen, free territory. Not able
to rind slave territoiy to conquer, for the purpose of
adding more slave States to our Union, we seize, and
seek to establish slavery in, free territory. Slavery,
hitherto, claimed to be only a State institution, has
come to bo regarded as a national one. insomuch that
tiee territory, the moment it is acquired by us, be
comes slave territory. Tho flag of the United States
planted on it, becomes the flag of slavery; and the
Constitution of the United States, ordained to ""estab
lish justice"" and ""secure the blessings of liberty,"" be
comes the law of slavery, so supremely, that neither
Congress nor the people of the territory have liny right
whatever to prohibit it.
Thus slavery, the name of which was not permitted
to defile the Constitution, and which, sixty years ago,
was declared to have tho consumption and to be struck
with death, has ""got well,"" grown fnt and lusty, and
talks of living forever. Permitted to stay among us
and b? protected, until time could be given it to die
decently, it has sprung upon its feet, taken the reins
of government, conquered foreign countties, and now
claims to extend over them ils power, for the purpose
of maintaining its ascendancy in the Union.
The question is now presented a question of such
magnitude, as to throw entirely into the shade, for the
present, all other questions of public policy how shall
the march of slavery be arrested, and ils alarming en
croachments he resisted ?
Thst a decided resistance should be made soon,
from some quarter, is very clear. New Mexico and
California are territories of the United States. The
purpose of their acquisition has been to extend over
them the institution of slavery; and that purpose will
soon be accomplished, unless prevented by tho govern
ment of the Union. Of that government the Piesi
dout about to be elected, is one of the branches, a
branch holding such a constitutional, and especially
such a practical relation to it, that tho great, question
of slavery extension is eminently involved in the elec
tion. The questions really to be decided by every
voter on tho 7th of November next, are, Will you ex
tend slavery over a free territory of six hundred thou
inni square miles? or will you stand upon tho present
liiriits of the Slates of the Union, and say to this en
croaching power hitherto shalt thou come but no fur
ther? Two candidates are presented by the leading par
ties. One has committed himself, expressly, on the
question of slavery extension. Knowing that the slave
power would give its support to no man, unpledged to
it, either expressly or impliedly, ho has given the
pledge and is committed to its interests. Tho other
candidate is the owner of some two or three hundred
slaves, purchased for labor, and worked for gain, upon
Ijouisiana plantations; and tne question is, shall he be
supported by tho friends of freedom, in this contest?
In the absence ol dehnite committals on the suhiect
of slavery extension, all the presumptions are cleaily
naniat linn. j ut,-iu its, in ma men jjiauu, lllli strung
bias ot a deliberate, habitual, unrelenting slave hold
ing. In the second place, he was originally pressed
into notice as a candidate, by slaveholders and slave ex
tensionists, and was their favorite candidate in the
Convention. On tho first ballot, ho received 8G out of
108 votes cast from the slave states, and on the last,
all thu votes from the slave states,but six. Throughout
all the ballotings, ho received the unanimous vote of
South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Flor'ula, Louis
utna, Terns, Tennessee, Arkansas and Missouri, and 15
of the 17 votes of Virginia, and 0 of the 7 voies oiM
abanm. The Georgia delegation which thus voted for
him throughout, was instructed by the Convention ap
pointing it, to vote for no man not opposed to the re
striction of slavery, and in favor of ' Southern rights.""
A laige portion of his supporters from the slave states
went into the Convention with a determination to sub
mit to the nomination of no man in favor of the restric
tion of Blavery. The legislatures of some of the
Southern states, as well as sundry meetings of slave
holders, had passed resolutions to that effect. And lo
confirm these presumptions, a resolution introduced
into the Convention, affirming opposition to the ex
tension of slavery, for the purpose of committing the
nominee and the party, was put down by the clam
orous opposition of his supporters, the party thus rk-
FUSING TO COMMIT ITSELF, UNDER THIS LEADER, a-
gainst extending slavery! In addition to all this, the
nomination has since been heartily concurred in by
those at tho South most decidedly in favor of extend
ing slavery; and even the most high-toned slavery ex
tension resolutions have been passed by meetings, at
which the nomination was ratified by acclamation.
Now has all this been done by the slaveiy propa
gandists, without good reason to believe that Gen Tay
lor is with them on the great question? Hive they
been taking a leap in the dark? Do they ever run any
hazard, when a question is to bo decided involving the
interests of slavery? Has it bi:en without purpose that
they have entered so zealously into the support of Gen
Taylor? There can ho hut one answer to these ques
tions. To mo the presumption is irresistible. And
Gen Taylor himself confirms it by his silence. He, of
course, understands the force of the presumption, il he
has the good sense claimed for him; and must perceive
that his silence will confirm it; and yet ho is silent!
Not a word of dissent escapes him.
To me It Is the plainest dictate of common sense and
even of common honesty, that Gen Taylor should
promptly disavow sentiments thus manifestly imputa
ble to him, if he does not entertain them. How cart a
man, with an upright, ingenuous mind, withhold a dis
avowal in such a case? It seems to me impossible and
therefore, if hois upright and ingenuous, it seems im
possible to avoid the conclusion that he entertains the
sentiments referred to. Yet in the face of this presump
tion, his Northern supporters claim that ho is with us
on the great question. What a strange position do
they thus place him in, in reference to his Southern
supporters Ais original fiends and the procurers of
ins nomination, it is tne position ot concealing Irom
Mem his real sentiments for the purpose of obtaining
their votes, with a determination to come out for tlie
.Vorth, when he shall thus have secured his election!
la this Gen Taylor? If it is, ho is surely riot fit to be
President. But 1 think his Northern friends do him
injustice by assuming that he is thus deceiving his
Southern supporters. Ho has no intention to deceive
them, and they are ioi deceived. Thev understand
him, and he understands them; and the result of this
mutual understanding is, a perfect assurance on their
part, that, in the language of Senator Mangum, of
N. Carolina, ""the question is safe in his hands.""
But it is said, notwithstanding all this, that General
Taylor will not go with the Suutri, and veto a bill re
stricting slavery, because he Ins said he would veto
no bill ""not palpably unconstitutional,"" and that ""the
will of tho Executive should not be interposed when
questions id' Constitutional power have beon settled by
the various departments of tho government and ac
quiesced in by the people."" But why does he deal in
these generalities, when the great question of slavery
extension is directly before him? It is to no purpose
to say that hi will veto no bill not palpably unconsti
tutional. Mr Calhoun hnuBoIt would say that; hut
shall we, therefore, support hi in for the Presidency?
What are Gen. Taylor's ideas of the Constitution
touching the minding of slavery? The South, w il h
out disiinction of parties, deem such restriction un
constitutional. Does lie, or does he not, concur in this
opinion? Why will ho not tell us? His Southern sup
porters do not understand him as intending to intimate
that he considers the restriction of slavery constitution
al, or that ""the question has been setlled' and acquies
ced in."" If they so understood him they would not
support him a moment. Have they not better means
of judging what application he will make of these gen
eral, indefinite expressions, than we have? And yet
it is demanded ot us, at tlie North, that we shall be
lieve that he means directly the reverse of his under
stood meaning among his friends ut the South! Now
why not quit this generalizing, and come lo the point?
Why go oil' upon expressions which bind bun, defin
itely, to nothing? He is praised as a Irank old soldier.
Let us have some evidence of Ins frankness. He says
in his ""Aliison loiter,"" that he has ""no concealments.''
Let us have some evidence of tho truth of this.- Here
under the most general, indefinite expressions, lie con
cealed his sentiments on a great, vital question. Let
him come forth from this concealment, take off the
mask, and stand up like a man. Refusing to do this,
how can we give him the credit of sincerity in his
profession of ""no concealment':'""
How in tho lace of all these presumptions, can we
be deceived by his general talk about Constitutional
power, and so forth binding him definitely to noth
ing, and evidently intended to bind him to nothing?
And more especially wlien we consider tho torce ot
Ins interests, his associations and his natural sympa
thies. Nobody can mistake as to the direction in
which those will lead him. Tho editor of the lead
ing whig paper in Tennessee (at .Nashville) sees tins
matter in its true light, when, in allusion to the rumor
that Gen. Taylor will favor the Wihr.ot Proviso, he
exclaims ""A Louisiana Flunlcr in favor of the Pro
viso! Why the intolerable absurdity of the proposi
tion almost forbids us to treat it with ai.y degree of
seriousness.""
The question, then, comes to this: Is Gen. Taylor
against all the strong biases of his mind, as a
""Louisiana planter"" against the well known expec
tations of his Southern friends and supporters and
against the pledge implied from his consent to be pre
sented, and itred by tliem as a candidate, going to
land up and breast tho current of Southern opposi
tion to the restriction of slaveiy? Let those believe
it who will. I do not. l o assume that he will, and
that the North may safely confide to him their inter
ests in this great conflict with the slave power, is
treading on ground that trembles at every step be
neath our feet. I hud rather be on terra Cirma.
The principal effort of the supporters of General
Taylor at the North, seems to bo to show that lie
will not veto a bill restricting slavery. But this, it
seems to me, is only looking at tho surface of the
question. There is, in my judgment, another aspect
of the case of much graver importance. There is no
certainty that a bill restricting slavery will ever
reach him lor his action, should he bo elected. Jlis
election would, of itself, in my opinion tend to prev
ent it.
There is, it should ho remembered, great moral pow-
in a Presidential election. It gives a tone and di-
er m a l resiacnttal election, it gives
rection to public opinion. The South understand
this. They see the pro-slavery tendency of rallying
the Northern wings of both parties to the support of
slaveholders, or candidates pledged to slavery; for
men naturally bring their sentiments and feelings into
conformity with those of the candidates they support
for office. The tendency in this direction is very
strong. But this is not the worst of the case. Tho
supporters of a successful candidate, become, in a
manner, committed lo his policy. The President must
be supported by Ins party. 1 Ins is, practically, the
law of parties. The .Yorl'iem Whigs arc walking into
this snare, and may find themselves under a very
strong temptation to abandon Northern rights, or
to shrink from a manly vindication of them. Do they
indulge the expectation that Gen. Taylor is to have
no mind of his own? Vain expectation! Ho will have
a mind, and will, and policy, on the whole suhiect ol
slavery; and it seems to nu; the Northern Whigs lire
running an immense risk, in committing themselves
to it, by giving him their votes. Let those do it,
however, who choose. In this matter I choose to be free
The influence which has heretofore been exerted
upon the Northern mind, through Presidential elec
tions, and commitments to tho policy of pro-slavery
Presidents has been immense. It is one ot the grand
secrets of the astonishing triumphs and continued
success of the slave power.
IJtlt turther. The rejection in the nominating Con
vention at Philadelphia, of the resolution against the
extensron of slavery, lias been proclaimed, at the
South, as a slavery-extension triumph; and the elec
tion of Gen. Taylor after thai rejection, will bo regard
ed as a lurther triumph a solemn decision of the
people of the United States against restriction. Who
can tell what complexion this assumed popular sane
tion of the vote of tho Convention, will gn'e to the
whole slavery intention? how much courage and con
fidence il. will"" impart to the slave power; and how
much influence it will exert in the elections, State
and Congressional? Lot this influence, and the gen
eral influence of electing a President standing in the
position of Gen, Taylor in regard to slavery and the
riends of its extension, come to exert their tull powe
upon Congress, and the mischief is done. There
will be no need of tho President's veto. The meas
ure of restriction will have been effectually versed in
advdvanee.
Gen. Taylor's supporters at the North are looking
narrowly to see it they cannot ruin aomo possible mean
ing in his general talk about the veto power, and the
settlement of constitutional questions, on which they
may hang a hope that he will be true to the interests
of freedom; while they seem entirely unconscious of
ine great danger, namely, mat ms election win insen
sibly shape the general policy of the government in
favor of slavery -give courage and confidence to the
slave power, and withal, such an impression of its
trength and influenco, as to secure enough of North
ern subserviency, m one or both houses of Congress,
to prevent lestrictive action if in no other way, by
compromising freedom out of its rights. Gen. Taylor,
it is said, is going to leave every thing to Congress;
but what Congress is to do, or refrain from doing,
under the influences of which I have spoken, and other
influences, is not said! All the mischief may he
done, by influences as subtle and insensible as those
of the malaria thai infects, and prostrates, the strong
est human frame.
Experience has shown lliat the influence of slavery
is every where, and unceasing. While we at the
North are divided on various questions-thoughtless
of tho necessity of effort to maintain freedom against
slavery, the slave poM'e'r is ever wakeful ever intent
on the one great purpose of governing the country
now in Congress, striving to mould its legislation, and
make it subservient to its interests, and now in Na
tional Conventions to give us Presidents and secure
the vast executive patronage of the government.
Nothing is too bold for the slave power to attempt;
and nothing it has attempted has ever failed of suc
cess. Shall it now succeed?- If it do not, it will not
be for want of the most Consummate management,
and tho most daring execution, thus far, of its pevus.
In the first place, it seduced from his natural alle
giance to the interests of Freedom the man who was
finally made the nominee of the Baltimore Conven
tion.
It next, went into the Philadelphia Convention, and,
thrusting aside all other candidates even Mr. Clay
himself for the ofi'ence of expressing in his Lexing
ton speech his opposition to the acquisition of more
territory, for the purpose of extending slavery it suc
ceeded in effecting a nomination of tho man whose
position I have attempted to define.- And what made
its triumph in this the more Unquestionable and hu
miliating, the nomination was of a man by a If'h'g
convention, who, opto that time, had stood sternly
aloof from the whig party declaring that he would
not be the exponent of its principles, hut would Ftand
on ground independent of all parties: declaring, even,
that he would be a. candidate though ""Mr. Clay should
he the nominee of the Whig National Convention,""
or ""whoever might be the nominee of the National
Convention, either of the Whig or Democratic par
tips."" And to make the triumph of slave ry and Gen.
Taylor over the whig party still more complete, the
nomina'ion was elft ctod after a resolution had been
v:ittd down, declaring that ""the claims of no candidate
can be considered by the Convention, unless such
camlmalu stanus pieugtm to support, m goou mini,
the nominees, and lo be the exponent of whig princi
ples."" After, indeed, matters had been put in such a
train as to render certain the nomination of General
Taylor in case his threat of running against the nom
inee of the Convention should be withdrawn, (for, up
to that hour, that threat had hung over the Conven
tion!) the Louisiana delegation presented a paper, de
claring that they, as his friends, would withdraw his
name, in case he should not receive the nomination,
and that they and he would abide by the decision of
the Convention; but they gave no pledge that he wou'd
be the. exponent of Whig principles, or am) principles;
nor has any such pledge been given to this day.
It seemed hardly necessary that the slave power
should have a further triumph, and yet it obtained a
most signal one, in the rejection of a resolution offer
ed after tho nomination had been made, declaring that
""tho Whig party, through ils representatives here, a
gree to abide by the nomination of General Z.achary
Tavlor. on condition that he wiil accept the nomina
tion as the candidate of the Whig party, and adhere
to the great fundamental principle jio extension of
slavery no acquisition of foreign territory by conquest
protection to- .linerican vutustry, una opposition to
Executive patronage.""
Thus the slave power succeeded in getting on to the
Whig National Convention, for the purpose of commit
ting the Whig party to his support, a candidate that
it had, up to that hour, determined to support inde
pendently of all conventions, and that it would, at this
moment, beyond all doubt, have had in the field ns an
independent candidate, but tor that nomination:
The results ot lite late Baltimore and Philadelphia
Conventions have produced in me a thorough convic
tion th.it, to neither of the parties, as at present organ
ized, can we look for an enectual stand against the
encroachments of slavery. Much of the opposition
to slavery, which exists in those parties is so neutral
ized by its party connection with slavery, as to be
come rather a sentiment than a living vigorous prin
ciple of action, so that it often yields when its ener
gies are most needed to counteract the machinations,
:tntl resist the encroachments, ot the slave power.
This was strikingly illustrated in the Philadelphia
Convention, which could never have been managed
into submission to that power, it Whig anti-slavery
had been what it ought to be but which it cannot be,
while associated icith slavery m an organized parly. I
think we may justly apprehend similar results, so long
as slavery forms a constituent element of two great
parties dividing the country. The firmness, and union
necessary to a successful maintenance of Northern
rights, I despair of seeing in parties thus constituted.
Freedom, somehow, suffers more from its party con
nections with slavery, than slavery does by its connec
tion with freedom. 'Slavery is firm, decided, uncom
promising, aggressive. It forms a bond of union
stronger than the ordinary ties of party, so that both
the parties at the south arc ready to coalesce, when
the ""peculiar institution"" is in danger. Hence its
power, and its success, hitherto. There has been but
one example of the southern portion of either the par ties
going for a Northern candidate for the Presiden
cy, unpledged to Southern interests; and no exam
ple of their supporting such a candidate in a nomina
ting convention. In 1840, the Southern Whigs went,
in a body, against Gen. Harrison, in the Harrisburgh
Convention ; but submitted to the nomination, and sup
ported him, because he was uncommitted on the main
question then in agitation between tho North and the
South, involving the possible a :tion of the President,
namely, the abolition of slavery in the District of Co
lumbia in regard to which, moreover, there was not
the slightest probability of any definite action of Con
gross during the then succeeding four years. The
Southern Whigs really yielded nothing in going for
Gen. Harrison ; and the case forms no exception to
the general rule of Southern union.
That union has been manifested in Congress, on
the question of the right of petition, and on every ques
tion materially affecting slavery; and it is now mani
fested in the Senate, and probably will be in the
House, on tho ""compromise"" which yields to slavery
tho great point for which the North is contending.
Whoever will examine the history of the lata Balti
more and Philadelphia Conventions, will see unmis
takeable ""videnceof a determination by the Southern
portions ol both parties, to submit to no nominations
which should present candidates not deemed safe on
the question of slavery extension. So decidedly was
this disposition manifested, both at, and before, the
conventions, as to leave no doubt that, had northern
men, with northern principles, been nominated, there
would have been a secession of the Southern portions
of both parties, and a union upon a candidate oppos
ed to tho restriction of slavery ; and that candidate, I
have no doubt, would have beon Zachary Taylor.
This undeniable state of tho case absolves tho
northern portions of both parties from all obligation to
support the nominations : while it shows the necessi
ty of their union in suppert of northern rights. South
ern union must be met by Xorthern union. If the south
are ready to throw nsid'e their party contests, for the
suite of extending slavery, there seems to be no alter
native for the North, but union to resist its extension.
But there are those who start, almost with horror,
at the idea cf such a union, because it involves a sec tional
division of parties, and will it is alleged, result
in a dissolution of the Union. Are wc, then to sub
mit, forever, to the encroachments of slavery, because
the Union necessary to resist them, may be bounded
by a geographical line ? But are wo sure that it mil
have any fixed, regular geographical limit ? For one,
I do not believe it will. I believe that a party based
upon uncompromising resistance to slavery extension
carrying with it, as it will ultimately, a divorce of
the government of the United States from slavery,-
leaving it, according to the true intent and meaning
1 0f the constitution, a mere State institution, with its

gradually advancing, southern boundary. It would
probably, now, embrace portions of Delaware, Mary
land, Virginia, Kentucky, and Missouri ; and in due
time, would reach Tennessee and North Carolina in
bodi of which States there are many, at this moment,
who would rejoice, openly or secretly, in such an or
ganization. So far from a dissolution of the Union beino- the
necessary, or probable result of such an organization
I think it necessary to the preservation ami perpetuity
of the Union ; or at least, to tho making it what it
should be, arid was intended to be by its founders.
The idea that this Union is forever to embrace the
element of slavery especially slavery in the ascen
dant, as it has hitherto been, is monstrous absurd
insufferable. If there is any one thing which, more
than all others, endangers the existence of the Union,
it is the present mad scheme ot slavery extension ;
for slavery and freedom cannot exist together, as it is
intended by the protectors ot this scheme. Let slav
ery be restricted within its present limits, and it will
die. JiiXtond it indefinitely carry out the scheme of
slavery propagandists, and this nation will die, if free
dom is essential to its life, and the providence of a
just God has anything to do with its preservation.
We are however exhorted to submit, and wait pa
tiently four years, and then we shall bo prepared for a
united ettort to arrest the progress ot slavery. Wait
lour years! we Have waited too long, already. What
is to be gained by postponement and submission ?
What can bo expected from parties thrown into con
ventions, in which slavery is a constituent element.
but a repetition of the scenes of 1848 ? Do we hope
to propitiate the slave power by submission ? or to bo-
come better prepared, by submission, to resist it here
after? Vain hope! We shall but bind our own
limbs for another sacrifice. And besides, if the north
do not awake now, and rally now, under the banner
of union, the daring attempts of the slave power will
bo successful the mischief will have been done ; and
all that will be loft for us will bo fruitless regrets and
bitter self reproach.
But wo must postpone, I am told, and go for Gen.
Taylor ; for if wo do not, Gen. Cass will certainly be
elected, and then our worst anticipations will be real
ized. Gen. Cass elected ! Who is going to elect him?
The South? No. He may get a portion, tho' I think
but a small portion, of the South. The man who has
changed to get Southern support, may change back a
gain. Gen Taylor, besides, is the man tor the South.
"" He is one of us,"" will be the language, and we can
trust him. Is New England going for Gen. Cass ?
New England ! I should as soon expect to see it float
off into the Atlantic Ocean, and double Cape Horn.
New York Is she going for Cass ? The ""Barnburn

of the North West, and move it deeply, if I know what that heart
is.

There is "" a more excellent way."" It is, to be united to cease
the divisions which are holding us in bumlatre to the slave power,
und slaud up together in defence of our riitlits.
But can we be united? That is the question. To eftect the de
sired union, strong partv ties must. be sundered, and iinrty aversions
overcome. The dilliculty of accomplishing this is not to be coiv
ealed. But is it insurmountable ? it seems to tne it is not We
ire in presence of a jireat a very great common daiiffer. It is im
minent, demanding immediate and united action. When the Brit
ish with mighty foit-e, on lake and land, came upon us in 1814,
party strife was hashed, and nil marched, shoulder to shoulder, to
meet the common foe. Hut what, really, was that danger compar
ed with this ?
Union, then, should he our watchword. The vital Interests of
freedom are put nt. Iruard, nnd the union th.it is doing it, I airain
repeat, mii-t he met by union. Divided we h tvo fall -n, and, divid
ed, we must ever fill, before the all-grwninir, ever-encroaching,
and never-satislied power ol slavery. Our own interests, nnd tho
interests of humanity alike urge ns, with a voice of resistless en
treaty to unite, and pot forth our full strength ag iinstthe daring
attempt to extend and prolong, indefinitely, the dominion and the
eurse of slavery in our country.
Let t tie people, then, come together, in mass meetings, and, t ik
ing each other hy the hand, ask What is there worth contending
about, when this question ot swallowing up the country in ttie bot
tomless pit of slavery, is broughthonie tons for immediate decision?
Let us thin do lighting this great battle with a union
that shall be as the heart of one man, and then, having
achieved a victory, as wo surely shall, if we are true to
ourselves and the cause of freedom, we will separale,
and fight our battles over again, if we can find il in our
hearts to do it. But, in the name t-f God and humani
ty let us be united now standing firmly and immova
bly upon the platform of ""No mure slave states No1
more slave territory; Free soil for free men."" A rally on
this platform will give a tone and direction to public
sentiment that will not long permit to be left undone
all that the constitution will permit to be done, to sep
arate Ihe national government fio.n its participation in
the guilt of slavery.
Union, llien, I repeat, should be the watchword; a
union in which the element of slavery shall not enter
upon a Platform where freedom may stand erect,
with limbs untettered, with nohody to command ana
nobody to threaten with strength known, principles
settled, a definite end in view, and a clear, well defin
ed responsibility to meet. In such a union there
would be a power before which slavery would tremble.
Such a union, more than any thing else, the slave'
power dreads.
I need not add that I am rejoiced that. an indepen
deat Convention is called, into which the element of
slavery is not to enter, but where men mny stand up,
and breathe freely. I hope it will speak forth, with a
voice af unmistakable distinctness, and be willing to
pledge itself and its candidates to something in the
skape of principles, so that the people may know, when
they put in then ballots, not only who but what they
are voting for. If there were but one request that 1
could malte of the convention, it would be that it will
not lead me blindfold to the ballot box.
Henceforth I can have little more to do with the election than to'
give mv vote. That vote wilt probably be given for the nominees
of tho Buffalo Convention. I say probably, for to the decision of
no nominating convention will 1 pledge mysell, betnrcliaiul. Bo
f-,r ns I am concerned. I wilt give no nominating convention reason
to expect thai t will sanction anything, and everything it may do
or not do. I will put my conscience (pardon the use of this obsolete
word) intothe keeping ol no convention, nut win juugo ot us rec
ommendations bv the reitsons given for them. I hold nominations
to lie mere recommendations, for the consideration of the people,
which, however, for the snke of harmony should doubtless over
rule minor objections. But claim that they are absolutely binding
according to modern party law, is to exercise a tyranny over the
judgment and conscience, to'Whicli no freeman who deserves the
name, can suhmil. Il transfers the elections, in effect, from the
people to the politicians, bo that the elections become the mere
farce of registering, the decrees of nominating conventions; in which
as a matter of course, not one voter in 5uO has any voice. Nomi
nating conventions have been grossly abused to bad purposes, and
the evil Is increasing. They arc becoming less and less the expo
nents of principles, and, more nnd more, the instruments ol in
trigue nnd corruption. It seems to me the time has come for a re
form. I regard the independent conventions in Massachusetts, New
York, and Ohio, which have been Ute result of the spontaneous up
rising of tho people, ns of inestimable value, for general reasons.
Independently of the special results that are likely to grow out of
them. They will show the people their strength, and do ""H, great
deal to emancipate them from the dominion of iuity spirit, and the
irresponsible control of parly leaders. .
Obeying the impulse of this great occasion, and the principles
whirh make it great, the Convention will, I trust, conduct its pro
ceeding with the wisdom, moderation, and mutual forbenrance,
becoming tho grave responsibility that rests upon it; and with an
elevation of aim, far above the purpose of accomplishing any ends
foreign to that ef its institution. This great movement, must be
begun right, for it is to have a mighty intluei.ee, for good or for
evil, upon the future destiny of the country.
The present crisis demands great sacrifices and self-denial.
There are, I trust, not a few who are ready to meet the demand.
One I know there is, for I know your, spirit. I have Blood by
your side in Congress, and have followed you with a brother's
Bolicitudc and affection and confidence ever since. One who was

f NEUTRAL RIGHTS.
l A premature announcement apfoared in
' * . some of our pepera, to the effect that the British
Government hod at la^t abandoned its old
doctrine concerning the rights of belligerents
in relation to neutral vessels, and much crodit i
was claimed for Mr. Buchanan, to whcao timely
acd wise interposition this great concession
was attributed. Wc did not credit the story, I
for Great Britain has an almost unconquerable
repugnance to surrendering any claim, the
eaerciss of which may, in come contingency or i
other, inure to her benefit: and we expressed
the opinion that she w.-uid simply waive, under
existing eircu instances, tho enforcement of
her old claims?an opinion confirmed by subsequent
intelligence.
The following is the Queen's Declaration on
^ the subject of Neutral Rights:
44 Her Majesty the Qoecn of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, having
' ' l<een compelled to take up arms in support of :
* l an ally, is desirous cf rendering the war as lit- I
tie onerous as possible to the Powers with
whrm she remains at peace.
? ' ' ""To preserve the c mincroe of neutrals from I
(all unnecessary obstruction, Her Majesty is
willing, for the present, to waive a part of the
belligerent rights appertaining to her by the !
"" ? . law of nations.
j ""It is iiiip<<ss.ble for Her Majesty to forego
the exercise of her right of seising articles contraband
of war, and of preventing neutrals
from bearing the enemy's dispatches, and she
must maintain the right of a belligerent to prevent
neutrals from breaking any effective blockade
which may be established with un adequate
force against tho enema's forts, harbors,
or coasts.
"" But Her Majesty will waive tho right of
soiling enemy's property la^eo on board a
neutral vessel, uule-e it be contraband of war
t u It is not Her Majesty's intention to claim
, the confiscation of neutral property, not being :

the regularly organised forces cf the country, it
ia not her present intention to issue letters of i
ij niai que fcr the coniotitaioning of privateers. j
41 1 ft.\thitr)s!er, Merck 28. 1851.""
I . The right to stiw articles contraband of w ar.
to prevent neutral* from carrying the enemy's
despatohis, and from Waking an effective
it blockade, established by an adequate force,
will be rigidly enforced; but ""her Majesty
will waive the right of soiling enemy's proper- ]
ij iwicu un n ocuir&i vessel, n nos con- j
itrab&nd of war, and doe? not intend to "" claim
the confiscation of neutral property,"" not fontraband
of war. on board enemy's ships.""
Practically, this pailiey, if continood during
I the war, will exempt us fr^m damage; but, it
will be observed that the Government averts !
the existence of the right to break up all com-1
meroe by neutrals with the enemies of Britain ; j
and the question whether it phall be exercised
or not, that Government reserves, subject alone
to its own* discretion.
After all, the only recurity that the United
States have for their neutral rights rests in j
their power to make them respected, and the
injury that Great Britain would be sure to
I sustain from any attempt to violate them. ..
Air. Wilson, the jLaud Commissiooer,
has tent into Congress a statement that the
whole surface of the United States embraces
only 1,391,480 320 acres, which is less by
220,704,599 than was reported in the annual
statement from the Land Office. The error
was ocmmit'ed in over-estiuiating the extent of
Oregon, Nebraska, and the Indian Territories.
The New York Tiuua thinks it is not neccvary
to feel humiliated by the dhnovery, as we
ars still large enough for all practical purposes.
Hon. Truman Smith has formally resigned
his plaee in the United States Senate,
and has apprised the citizens of Connecticut of
the fact, in a brief, bat very feeling and ap propriate
addre*). His resignation is to take
jj effect on the 24th of May.
FABTIES A2TO SLAVEBY. "" j
' Line upon liae, precept upon precept!"" 1
How alow id the progress of Truth, when Pro- '
judice and mistaken Self-Interest oombine to 1
oppose it! c
Three-quarters of a century ago, Lord Mans- '
field decided that Slavery was so odious, and a
so repugnant to natural right, that it could I
not exiet except by positive law. Abcut the 1
same time commenced the agitation against j 1
the slave trade, a traffic deemed honorable by j c
Christendom, and carried on not unfrcquantly j c
by companies instituted by Royal charters. : 1
Prom that time to this, the subject of Slavery '
in all its relation."", moral, eccial, economical,
and political, has boen under discussion in all ^
civil zed countries. The slave trade has come c
to be denominated piracy; England, France, a
and Denmark, have abjlh-bed Slavery in their ;
colonies; of the original States of this Union, i a
; seven have put en end to it within their bor- , e
j tiers, either by judicial detrition or legislative ; T
j enactment; six new free States have been or- ' *
' ganizod out ofTerritory exempted frcm it by Cou- , a
greesiooal ordinance; an Emancipation Party 8
has been organized in Rrazil; and in Cuba, a ^
system of measures looking to ultimate aboli- '
tiou has lately been commenced, under author- j 6<
ity of the Homo Government. All these 1""
important events have been attended with di?- ! P
cuesicns, learned, comprehensive, thorough. ! ^
The highest authorities in Law, Government, | ^
Religion, and Philosophy, havo been arrayed | *
- T a oi I I n
; n?iuiib?, oiivcrjf. j In
our own country, the struggle between it I 1
and free principles ha-* been more protracted *
and fierce than in any othor ; for here in the
Beat, at once, of the beat organized, moat deeply ^
rooted, most extensive, ao<l moat powerful eye- a
tcm of Slavery, and of the beet developed, most K
comprehensive, and rooit beneficent system of h
Free fhstitutions, that the world has ever wit- 8'
n eased. For seventy.five years has the strug- &
gle been going on, at first to tho disadvantage a
of Slavery. For, no one can doubt that, when j *
the Declaration of Independence was pro
claimed, when one State after another of the | U1
Old Thirteen, stimulated by the liberal spirit o( j
the Revolution, and aided by the operation of , ""I
natural causes, throw off its burden ; when j
the last Congress of (he Confederation passed ;
the celebrated Ordinance eonsoerating the ; m
whole of the Territory then belonging to the j foi
Union to Freedom; when the framers of the \ ac
uew Constitution refused to introduce tho word j at
""Slavery"" into that instrument, and treated : th
the thing itself as an evil to be tolerated for a D
time : and when all the slave States, with a J ej
single exception, passed acts prohibiting the , th
slave traffic,?tho Anti-Slavery sentiment was ' th
in the ascendant, and Free Institutions were i
steadily gaining upon Slave Institutions. ; fn
But, for reasons that we have often explain- dc
ed, tho latter began to acquire strength, tho hii
former to lose something of their expansive to
power. The struggle between them became
more doubtful, now inuring to the benefit of an
one system, then to that of the other, until, at us
last, we find thorn treating and compromising, hi
almost on a footing of equality. as
And now, what is the spectacle presented 1 Ni
Slavery in actual occupation of more than half oc
of the original area of the Union, and of the su
acquisitions from France and Spain, and claim- wl
icg possession of all the rest of our Territory, ! dii
more than six hundred thousand square miles, tir
not yet organized into States. Yes?after three- 1 of
quarters of a century, in which Freedom and bu
Slavery have been striving for the mastery, we
find fifteen Slave States in the Union, three ut
millions instead of half a million of slaves, nine ce
' I
hundred thousand instead of four hundred ; ox
thousand miles of Slave Territory, and a power fo
growing out of the Moneyed Interests of Sla- th
very, which gives law to the Federal Govern- i lu
znent, and claims that Slavery shall be the se
common law in all the Territory within its ju- |
risdiction. SI
Now, have we not a right to say, that the j
People to whom mote especially have boen
committed the interests of Free Labor Institutions,
who have grown up under their infio- fr(
t-nces, who have reaped their benefits, whose gi
welfare is identified with their preservation j ?
and growth, have either failed to comprehend j *h
their full claims, the inherent antagonism be- ^
tween th'-m and the pretensions of Slavery, 1?
and the necessity of active efforts for its re- Pr
emotion and their extension, or have proved m
false to their own convictions ? ^
After the disoussiocs of a century, with the
world's example on their side, with the world's a^
Litcrsiture. and Religion, and Law, speaking
for Liberty, with all the early precedents in
oar own history, and tho original policy of the 631
Government in their favor, what could have m
given to this hateful Institution of Slavery ^a
paramount power and consideration in this ar
model Republic, a Moneyed And Political Pow- ^
er, such as it has enjoyed nowhere else on the 80
face of the globe ? What, but gross indiff^r- Ui
ence, shameful ignorance, or base treachery on ca
their part? ar
We may acquit ourselves of treachery, but in
of shameful indifference and ignorance we
m-x't bear tho blame. When we remember cc
that we have had on our side the public opin- ^
ion of mankind, the civilization of modern a
time1, the Truth of God, the testimony of our w
Fathers, the Declaration of Independence, the
Principles of the Constitution, superior wealth cc
and numerical force, and always a majority A
in tlie rsationai legislature, it h a damning at
disgrace to us, that at this day. the Slave In- tfa
tercst should be the controlling ckment in the fo
Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Depart- cc
ments of the Federal Government; so control- ci
ling, as to make an honest avowal of opposition oi
to Slavery, a bar to political preferment, almost st
& cause of social proscription. rt
What has sunk the People of this country^ w
identified with the Cause of Free Labor Insti- lx
tutions, to su jh a depth of degradation ? Kx- ci
elusive devotion to their own material interests. r?
and stolid ignorance of the true nature, neccs- SI
sities, and policy, of Slavery, as well as of the ei
policy required to give to Free Institutions B
their just weight in the Union. U
These vioes, for vices they are, have been st
fostered by their old political organic&tions, tl
which have been formed without reference to it
Human Rights, to Free Labor, or Slave Labor, n
Hie alpha and omega of their statesmanship fi
have boeo material interests?the acquisition of 1]
Territory, the promotion of Cummeroe, the de- a
vclopment of the physical resources of the coun- w
trv. Meantime, an Interest, distinct, insulated, tl
sinister, all-grasping, has confronted thorn both, si
with demands for special protection, special fa- oi
ois; and, intent on their main objects, unwil- h
ling to jeopard them, or* impair their political P
power, they have yielded, and yielded, and
! yielded, until that Interest has become their ?
I dictator. . . h
In this way has the battle been turned in *>
fhvor of Slavery ?in this way have the men n
brought up amidst Free Labor Institution* been
obliged to forewear hostility to Slavery before ft
they could expect favor at the hands of the fil
Federal Government ?in thin way have the ^
Non-Slaveholders of the oountry been dragged ?
under the yoke of three hundrod thousand '
, Slaveholders! ?i
What is the remedy? Break that yoke, S
and be true to yourselves ; bat this you cannot p
do, till you break to pieces the Whig and ii

sentiment. Lot any one take the trouble to for
:amine the speeches made by distinguished ing
eo at these Anti-Nebraska meeting*, and the coc
nguage and spirit of the resolutions adopted, vol
id ho will see that a change has come over the
ie mind of the North and West. In tho ab- sen
nee of the old declarations of- devotion to the Pol
nion, in the coldness with whioh its value is 1
.lcolated, in the determined avowal of resist- the
ice to Slavery-aggrets.on, cost what it may, and , of 1
the not infrequent allusion to a separation of to
e States, as, after all, holding out tho only me
rtain mode of overthrowing the tyranny of the
e Slave Interest, he will deteot the growth of the
Sentiment, full of warning to Slaveholders too
id their Northern auxiliaries.
TH
But slaveholders misunderstand, and will
mticue to misunderstand, the free States,
n overweening estimate of their own power
id consequence leads them astray. They say
iat cotton is necessary to the world's comrt,
to the world's industry, to the world's
mmeree : that it gives employment to the I
ipital, the manufactories, and to the shipping in*
' the Northern States; that it is the great
aple of their commerce, the chief source of
; venue to the Federal Government; that the tra
or king classes of England, without it. would trl<
a compelled to veuture on Revolution, to ee- 1
ipe starvation ; that in this way tbo world is
sndercd tributary to and dependent upon 0f
lave Labor?the Slave Labor of the South- fee
n States. This is why they bully Great 1
ritain just as they do the free States of this 061
nion. This is why, in the face of the reroonrances
of both, they persist in imprisoning ^
leir colored seamen. This is why their leadig
organs affect to regard Russia as their
atural ally, abute England as they do the ari
eo States, for Abolition fanaticism, and boldT
propose to defy the power of the former
nd coerce that of the latter, io the plot to ed
rreat Cuba from Spain. Nothing could lead *15
iem to assume such an attitude, but the delu- .
on that the dependence of the free States and
f Great Britain on cotton will compel them
J forbearance, no matter how extreme the
ro vocation. ev
The People of the free States are not aware St
f the estimate placed upon them by Slave- M
olden. These men have reasoned themselves f0i
ito the belief that the North and West can- sic
ot thrive without them, and that thsp know W
We raise, say they, two-thirds or three- pl<
)urt&s of all the products exported from the es<
cuntry. The navigation laws secure to your th
lipping the profits of carrying -these to for- lei
gn ports, and bringing back goods in ex- th
hange. The imposts on these supply the revcue
of the Government, so that we of the Pc
outh pay two thirds or three-fourths of the im
ublic expenditures. And then we pay your Bt
n porters and merchants millions annually as -gj
he agents for carrying on our commerce with
lurope. The wealth of your merchant princes, da

Jur vaet manufactures, your unparalleled

cur merchants would become bankrupt, your
?nw would stop, Labor would be turned out
> starve, grass grow in the streets of your
ities; while we at the South would scarcely
now the event, save by the telegraph and
liiroad.
With this estimate of the absolute dependice
of the free States upon them, is associated
oonviotion that their People are more devod
to the Union than to any earthly good, that
iere are no saorificee so humiliating that they
re not willing to make them for the sake of
srpetuating it And this is not all?so yieldg
has been the policy of the free States, so
;coblc and servile has been the deportment of
large number of their Representatives and
snators in Congress, so tamely have they subittcd
to political degradation, that tbey have
ime to entertain a contemptuous opinion cf
orthern spirit and character. They always
:t on the assumption that Northern men are
rdid, flexible, and cowardly. There is no
;aggeration in all this. Members of Congress
om the free States, not blinded by Party, not
udered mercenary by sordid self-seeking,
iow and feel that it is true.
But, with such views and sentiments predling
among slaveholders, what can be exacted
but just such aggressions, pretensions,
id assumptions of superiority, as characterise
eir whole intercourse with the North? Were
>t such views and sentiments prevalent among
em, would they dare demand the abortion
the covenant which now exempts Nebraska
>rg Slavery ? Would they recklessly avow the
irpoee of obtaining possession of Cuba, to
event emancipation there, and to establish
rever in the Union the ascendency of the
are Power? Would they ooolly attempt to
ke from the Public Treasury twenty millions
dollars to buy Mexioan Territory, aad seoure
e subservience of the needy, unscrupulous
venturer who calls himself the Dietator of
exico, with a vjew to the immediate extension
the area of Slavery southwardly, to paving
e way for future extension, as it may become
pedient, and to oonnecting slaveholding terriry
by a National railroad with one of the
ist important seaports on the Pacific?
Their policy is plain. They will hold possesm
of the Federal Government, by playing off
:lions in the North and West against one
other, use the power and the money of the
>vernment for the aggrandizement of Slavery
a too expansion ot aiave i erntory, ana tnus
spare themselves for absolute sway over the
stinies of the Union. Then, should the PubOpinion
of the free States bo at last so exjerated
as to demand Dissolution, the aner
would be, "" As you please;?we have the
ivernment and the Territories; we form an
ipire within ourselves; we have no occasion
secede; if you do not like the association,
pi can leave, being of the least possible acaut
to us. We have long looked forward to
s hour ; and by the acquisition of Cuba, the
uoxation of Mexican Territory, our Southern
ite to the Paoific, and the useful services of
r pensioner in Mexico, Santa Anna, we are
ite prepared for your departure.""
rhis is the policy of the Slave Interest,?sumiacy
in the Union, and aggrandisement of
ivery through the power of the Union; and,
ally, should the North and West be aroused
resistance, Dissolution, the onus of secession
ng placed upon them, tho Federal Governnt,

iveholdew. One thing is necessary to thisconnmation?the

of the free States by the Whig and Demotic
organizations, with their miserable, tmpuit
pretences about "" Compromise "" and Natality.""

Extract from the Proceedings of the Senate.
This record is a specimen of what takes place
ery day. The free States petition; the slave
ates are silent. So it was in 1848 and 1850. '
emorials against Slavery poured in from the
*mer; from the latter was heard an ooeamal
protest against the Wilmot Proviso,
by this difference 1 Is it because the Peo- i
a of the slaveholding States are less interted
in the question of Slavery-extension, than !
oee of the non-el aveholding ? Are their views j
a decided 1 Are they more indifferent to j
e policy of their Representatives in Congress *
it from it Why then so silent, while the
>ople of the free States are forever petitiong,
memorializing, remonstrating, protesting?
icause the latter are misrepresented in Janets;
the former, always represented.
Slaveholders, as General Cass estimated from
ita furnished by the census, constitute a dis#
SGTON, D. C., APRIL
tinct ola?fi of three hundred thousand. Allowing
to each a family, or dependents, to the
number of five white persons, we have eighteen
hundred thousand people in teres ted in the eyfttem
of Slavery. Let us concede that the number
is two millions, or one third of the whole
free population of the slave States. It is this
class that constitute the People of the South;
that control its Press and the Pulpit, its ooolesiastical
and political organisations. Publle
opinion is determined by them. They decide
elections; they dictate laws and prescribe the
mode of administration. Who are the Representatives
and Senators in Congress from the
South?non-slaveholders, agents of the four
millions of free people in the South, who own
no slaves ? With here and there an exception,
all slaveholders, representing the one-thhd
class, that has monopolised all politioal power
in tho slavehclding States.
Who then are to send up petitions from the
South, in regard to Slavery ? Not the four
millions of noo-slaveholders, for they are virtually
shut cut from political life, exeept the
privilege of voting for such candidates as the
Ruling Class may dictate to them. And why
should any member or adherent of this olass
petition ? Why should Power beg of itself to
take oare of its own prerogatives, protest
against its own acts? Classes, Oligarchies,
Aristocracies, protect themselves, watch over
and provide for their own interests. Whenever
a question arises involving the welfare of the
Slaveholding Class, the two millions in the,
South interested in it need give themselves no
uneasiness. The Senators and Representatives
whom they have sent to Congress understand
what is to be deqe, and do it, without
suggestion or petition. With them, as with
their constituents, tho interests of their olass
are paramount, and they never betray their
trust.
How different the state of things in the free
States ! As a general rule, Questions of Slavery-are
thrust out of their politics. In one
place, a member is chosen because he will favor
some railroad scheme of plunder; in another,
to secure the interest of some steamboat
monopoly ; commercial reasons dictate the selection
of this man ; that one will work for the
manufacturer ; Rum is prevalent in one case;
the Maine Law in another; while paramount
to every other consideration, is loyalty to the
Whig or Democratic Party, the organization of
each being pervaded by subservience to Compromise
and Nationality as defined by the Slave
Power.
Thus, New Hampshire, after having year
after year passed resolves in favor of the polioy
of Slavery restriction by Congressional legislation,
elects two Senators, on the strength of
their devotion to the Democratic Party, without
the slightest reference to their Principles on
the subject of Slavery, and their most signal acts
are, speeches and votes against that policy! So
the free States of Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa,
professing to be unfriendly to Slavery, and opposed
to its extension, send Senators to Congress,
who, on every question involving tho inter-,
eats of the Slavehoiding Class, no matter how incompatible
with the views and interests of their
constituents, vote with the representatives of
this Close.- Look at Ohio. It is notorious that
the majority of her People are Anti-Slavery?
no one who knows anything of their history and
character can doubt that, in regard to Slavery,
and nearly all other important Questions, Senators
Chase and Wade have nobly represented
their opinions and wishes. And yet, the dominant
Party in the Ohio Legislature chooses, as
the successor of one of these gentLmen, a man
who, so far from being imbued with the prevalent
ideas of his State on the subject of Slavory,
concurs in the extreme views of the Slaveholding
Class of the South. And then this
Party, styling itself Democratic, tells us that,
in electing him, the Question of Slavery was
not taken into consideration !
These are mere illustration* of what is the
usage under tho present political organization
of the free States. And the result of this usage
is, the gross misrepresentation of their opinion
and interests on Questions of Slavery. Whenever
a crisis comes, in which a great question
is to be decided between Liberty and Slavery,
you find a large body of Northern Representatives
and Senators acting with the Ruling Class
l/I VUO J'JUWlj no OlUUUUIUlJ uuu vtuvutvuwj uo I
if chosen expressly to take care of its interests.
What a pitiable spectacle! The Free States
hare a free population of fifteen or sixteen millions,
abounding in enterprise, wealth, resources?characterized
by ingenuity, intelligence,
energy?distinguished, as compared with the
rest of the country, for Literature, Science, ,
Arts?boasting of their Common Schools, Colleges
and Churches,?and yet, whenever any.
Question arises about Slavery, we see them
humbly petitioning their agents not to betray
tbeir interest"", while the Ruling Class of the
South, silent, dignified and stern, knows the ,
fidelity of its agents too well, to trouble itself
with apprehensions, or them with petitions. It i
sends men to Congress to maintain and ex- i
tend its Power; and they do it. The fifteen {
millions of People in the Free States send men
to Congress?in God's name, for what? Will
any one tell us ? O, to secure grants for railroads,
appropriations for steam companies, {
patronage from the Government, and take
Bare generally of the interests of "" Democra- j
By"", and ""Whiggery;"" and if all this cannot ]
be d >ne save by truokling to the President and i
genuflexions to Slavery, and treaohery to the i
Cause of Freedom, they need not hesitate?the i
Party Managers at home or in Washington
will take care of them. I
How admlrablo must be the politics of these i
fifteen millions of free People, to accomplish 1
iuch results! Sending men to Congress to
make laws fof them, and following this up with
protests against their acts! Sending men to Con- (
Kress to protect their rights and interests, and <
then begging them Dot to betray them ! "" The i
exactions of these Slavery Propagandists are
intolerable,""says anexoited Democrat. ' That's i
a fact,"" responds his Whig neighbor. "" How
long shall those things be !"" exclaims Deacon
Smith. And then the three go straightway
and forget all about their grievances in a hot
nruntA?t hftfarnan Whiff and Dftmocratio nandi
date<<, the creatures of caucuses, acting with
exclusive regard to availability, some petty local
interest, or Federal patronage, with not the
lightest reference to Liberty or Slavery.
The mere fact that so many thousands of
petitions are sent to Congress from the free
States whenever Questions of Slavery oome up,
is a demonstration that they are under the
sway of organizations that do not embody or
represent their sentiments .on these Questions.
Were their oitizens true to themselves, they
would fill Congress with Representatives who
would do their duty without the aid of petitions
or protests. Let them use the Ballot
for Liberty, and they may d.spense with the
Petition. Let them send Representatives to
take eare of the interests of Freedom, and it
will be done: if they will not do this, they have
no right to complain when betrayed. Betrayed
they deserve to be, all their petitions and protests
to tile contrary notwithstanding.
Jn the last Congress, there were some eight
Representatives, expressly elected because they
Considered the Question of ffoman {liberty
paramount to all others. Did thejr constituents
ever doubt them? Did they dream of
i 20, 1854.
troubling them with petitions not to piny false ?
Suppose the Senate were filled with such men
as Senators Chase and Sumner, and the House
with such men as De Witt, Wade, Giddings,
and Gerrit Smith, it would not be necessary for
Legislatures to resolve, the People to petition,
the Clergy tg protest, whenever the Slave Power
should attempt an aggressive movement The
timely use of the Ballot would have superseded
the necessity of an appeal to the Petition.
Without being petitioned, the Senate of the
United States promptly doee the will of three
hundred thousand Slaveholders and their white
dependents; while it is yet unoertaiirwhether
legislative revives, popular petitions, olerioal
protests, can compel obedienoe to the will of
fifteen millions of Free People, on the part of a
House in which their Representatives have a
majority of fifty-nine! Are these People satisfied
with the spectacle they exhibit?betrayed
by their Representatives, spurned by the Slaveholder?,
baffled and beaten by a email class of
determined men, who, disdaining to beg, command,
knowing that their will is the Law of
their agents?
If they are satisfied, let them submit to vassalage,
without grumbling: if they are not, let
them trample under foot effete political organizations,
whose cherished names, "" Whig "" and
"" Democratic,"" serve but to cloak their habitual,
ineradicable servility to Slavery. Let them
spurn the Parties that have given them such
leaders as Webster, Cass, Fillmore, and Pierce,
such creeds as the Baltimore Platforms, suoh a
master as the Slave Interest, and unite as one
man, in the assertion of the right of a free,
triumphant majority at the Ballot Box, and
through it, wrest from Slaveholder* the Administrative
Powers of the Federal Government.

WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
Suppose your Party of Freedom triumphant
at the polls, a majority in Congress, and ascendaut
in the Federal Exeoutive, what would you
do 1 inquires tke slaveholder. Do much that
i> ci. i ?i J i ?
jruur x aiijr ui omvcrj uoo hui uuiiu, buu uxjuu
much that it baa done.
Wd would repeal the act of 1801'-?-2, by which
the slave code of Maryland was continued in
this District, and pass a law here for the protection
of personal freedom.
W e would repeal that part of the act of 1808,
by which regulations were established for the
transportation of slaves coastwise, and pass an
act declaratory of the impossibility of the exi6tenoe
of Slavery under the Amerioan flag on
the high seas.
We would forbid the seizure and sale of slaves
under United Statos process.
We would repeal the act of 1850, and that
of 1793, in relation to fugitives from service or
labor1
We would enact a law, declaring that there
shall be no Slavery or involuntary servitude in
any Territory of the Union, now existing, or
that may hereafter be acquired, or anywhere
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Fedoral
Government.
In Federal Legislation, touching the subject
of Slavery, our action then would be the exact
reverse of yours. You, by acts of Congress,
clearly unconstitutional, have established and
supported Slavery within Federal Jurisdiction,
and, by preventing^ the oxercise of constitutional
authority by Congress, allowed the evil to
gain foothold in Federal Territory. We would
repeal those acts, and also exert that authority
so as to exolude Slavery from every foot of
soil under the exclusive control of the Federal
Government.
In regard to the organization of Congress,
the construction of the Administration, and
the distribution of Patronage, wo would act
for Liberty, as you have done for Slavery;
by assigning to the consistent friends of
Freedom and Free Labor, the majorities in
all important committees in both Houses of
Congress; by securing them the control of the
Cabinet and th$ various Executive Departments
; by excluding Pro-Slavery men, as you
have excluded Anti-Slavery men, from offices t
of trust and influenco ; and by giving to applicant*
for office in slavebolding States, favorably ,
disposed to Emancipation, the preference over
these committed to the support of perpetual (
Slavery, }ust as you have preferred for office
in the free States, the opponents, to the friends, (
of Emancipation. j
The results of thus changing the position and (
policy of the Federal Government would be of |
incalculable importance. ,
The free States would be absolved of all po- I
litical responsibility for Slavery, and relieved
from that corrupt spirit of Compromise and that '
servility among their politicians which now de- ,
base their politics, and to a fearful extent havo f
lowered the tone of their religious sentiment. ]
The Federal Government would no longer be i
an instrument of the Slave Interest, its power '
prostituted, its treasury plundered, its patronage
abused, for the extension of the area and
influence of Slavery, but made to minister c
to the protection and extension of Free Institu- (
tions. Political Parties would no longer be or- j
ganized on the basis of Compromise with Sla- r<
very, nor would the disguise or renunciation of 1
Anti-Slavery sentiments bo necessary, as now, 1
to politioal preferment. Servility in the free (
States, Pro-Slavery fanaticiem in the slave
States, would be as opprobrious as Froe-Soilism ^
in the former and Emancipationism in the (
latter are now. The Slave Interest, dispossessed i
of the control of the Federal Government, ,
stripped of its political consequence and pat- '
ronage, with no power to punish or reward,
would cease to be feared at the North and j
South, and it would not be long before the citi- ;
zons of the slave States, two-thirds tf whom
have no interest in tho support of Slavery,
would begin to manifest their opposition to it.
An Emancipation Party in the South would be
one Of the results of breaking down the osooDdency
of the Slave Power in the Federal Government.
It* tyranny over Southern sentiment
would be gradually weakened, and the impossibility
of any further expansion of Slave territory
would favor the gradual development of
an opposition to tho perpetuation of the Slave
system, which would finally assume the form
of legislation for its extinction.
Let us not, then, ocnoeal from ourselves the .
utter antagonism between the party of Slavery {
and the'nartv of Freedom the r.roeinelv onno- (
I J ? ?, k j rr
site policies they propose, the precisely opposite
results to be ezpeoted, according as one
or the other may obtain the final oontrol of
the Federal Government. If the party of Slavery
shall continue in the ascendant, as it is
now, Mid go on from victory to victory, but
one alternative will be open to the free States,
Nationalization of Slavery in all Territories of
the Union, with absolute subservience of all those
States to its interests, or Secession. On the
other hand, if the party of Freedom obtain
and maintain ascendency in the Federal Government,
the law of Liberty will be established
throughout all Territory of the Union, and
Slavery confined to the States in which it
now exists, until its final overthrow by an
Anti<Slavery party in these States, the catu- ]
ral result of the subordination of the Slave
Interest, and the limitation of Slave territory.
And this, or Secession, will be the alternative
submitted to the slave States.
What say the American People to this?
4*e they prepared for this systematic, direct
struggle with the Slave Interest, or not T The
\ ,
4
nucleus of this Party of Freedom exists, under
the name of the Independent Democratic organization.
We, who sustain this Party, hare
surveyed the whole ground, weighed the
oonsequences, and are prepared to meet
them. No other way can we disoern, by
whioh the Slave Power can be overthrown, ;
and the Federal Government and the free
States absolved from responsibility for Slavery
extension and perpetuation. The Democratic
and Whig Parties hold out no hope. Their
fixed policy is compromise and concession.
The "" oompromises of the Constitution,"" as
they are called, instead of being assented to by
them, with a clear view of their tendencies to
undermine the popular attachment to bnman 1
rights, and paralyse the public conscience on
the evil of Slavery, and with a determination
to counteract these tendencies by a rigorous
construction of them, and by the liberal exercise
of all constitutional powers in favor of
Liberty, are habitually glorified by them, and
appealed to as precedents for still more inju-,
rious oompromises. Their policy on the subject
of Slavery is a perpetual reproduction and
aggravation of these compromises.
The general spirit and provisions of the Constitution,
which are all in favor of Freedom,

provisions in relation to Slavery, and the*e, I
not those, govern and shape their whole action.
Their Northern sections struggled hard against
what are oalled the Compromised of 1850, but ""
when, by Northern treaohery, they were overpowered,
they submitted, ceased to oom plain,
and at last through N ational Conventions, and <
National Candidates for the Prosiiency, rati- |
fied them, as finalities. Now, they are resisting j
the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, the i
Northern Whigs, unitedly, because out of
power?the Northern Democrats, partially, because
they are in power, and the measure is
sustained by tbeir Administration. But, let '
the Bill pass, and you will see these old par- '
ties, at first protesting, then submitting, at
last ratifying the measure, as a final settlement.
Thus always will it be. Each new aggression
of Slavery will be met by resistance, determined
on the part of the old party out of
power, debilitated on tho part of the old party
in power, but if oomplianco be secured, both
will submit, acquiesce, ratify. The Northern 1

No attempt to dispossess Slavery '
of the vantage ground it holds, is dreamed of. 1
Indemnity for the past, security for the future, .
is not an article in the creed of either Whigs or
Democrats, as they call themselves. Unorganized,
unsystematic, unintelligent resistance, on
single issues, raised by Slavery, is their policy,
not adopted, but forced upon them. Our policy,
the policy of the Independent Democratic organization,
is, deliberate, systematic, thorough- 1
ly organized opposition to all usurpations of
Slavery, accomplished, in progress, or in conception.
Their policy is negative and partial;
ours, positive and complete. Essentially, there
is no difference between the Whig and Democratic
Parties?-Compromise lies at the foundation
of both?Compromise disqualifies both for '
effective opposition to the Slave Power. Com- '
promise we repudiate and spurn, and within
the limits of the Federal Jurisdiction ask no '
favors from Slavery, and will give it nono.

%0 CHANGE OF POLICY.
In one of cur art;elcs on the organization of '
the friends of Freedom, we pointed to tho reconstruction
of the Whig Party, now every- 1
where in progress, and to the danger that po- j
litical Anti-Slavery men or Independent Democrats,
in their zeal to baffle the Nebraska
conspiracy, might inconsiderately ruffer themselves
to bo absorbed by that organization. '
They were right in desirirg a united demonstration
against that mischief, but this could
be accomplished without a sacrifice of their
own organization. Co-operation, not"" Fusion.,""
was their true policy. ThiB would meet the 1
demands of the present crisis, and secure tho a
immediate good, so important to the interests ?
of Freedom, and at the same time preserve 1
their independence of an organization, which,
acting nationally, has always been subservient (
to the Slave Interest. And we added : i
' Our Free Soil friends must take care lest
they find themselves carried as grist to the
Wk>g mill; an operation for which the New
Vork Tribune, with ali its real Anti-Slavery
ipirit and its independence of party, is admira- f
Lily adapted, the more so because it acts from c
i kind of constitutional instinct, rather than I1
from cold premeditation.""
The Tribune replies:
"" As to ' the Whig mill' of which tho Era j
speaks, we are not awaroof any such intent J
is is implied. Whenever the Anti-Slavery ,
grist can be better ground in tho Democratic (
mill, we would have it carried thither. We c
object only to the policy of waiting for a new ,
ind vastly superior mill to be built, and tnean- t
:ime letting the grain mould and the would-be t
waters famish. Better have the grist indiffer- ti
jntly ground, than not at$11."" o
That is to say?better have the Anti-Slavery e
griat ground out at the Whig mill, in the shape ^
>f such products as Clay, Taylor, Fillmore,
Webster, Soott, and Everett, than not ground *
it all?wherein we decidedly differ from the '
Tribune. Such milling is worse than none. ^
But the Tribune baa a labored article in re- &
dy to our'views. in which, after having freely K
ndnlged in vague generalities about Party and w
Parties, it frankly admits all that wo have 6
?redictod as to its future course. The follow- P
ng extract leaves no room for doubt as to the '<
,o!icy of that journal on the question of Sla- u
cry: - ?
""We certainly are not particularly devoted w
;o tho Whig organisation. Oo the contrary, t<
vhen we saw Gen. Soott ignominiously defeat- a
?d by men who boAst of being Wbigs par ex- u
ellence, we thought the time had fully arrived

nan for openly and-manfully siding against v

!t is at all times his right, often his duty, to do ti
lo. But when a large and previously leading

onger concur in the action nor Bupport the ^
;andidates of that party, then it seems to us
ligh timo that the party should formally dis- t<
>o1t6 and be reconstructed. Apart from our e
conviction that all party organizations necessarily
tend, as they grow old, to become corrupt 0
*nd the shelter of corruption, and that it would '
3e well for the country if each party wote o
formally dissolved and broken up at least once J
n twelve years, we believe that there wae spe- 0
rial reason for the dissolution of the Whig par- .
Ey after the disaster of '52, and that its breakng
up at that time would have been a nation- *
il blessing.

in a war, held by the Whig party to he unctB
c;?sary and wicked, was the Presidential ear B

as anti-slavery and anti-war then as it in not B
supported him. Ho was elected?he died-B
Millard Fillmore, tho Whig Vice President B
succeeded, under whose auspices the policy cfB
slavery restriction was waived, the Wilnn B
Proviso given up, tho Fugitive Slave Lt?B
passed, and the popular excitement on theB
subject of Slavery allayed to such an extent B
that both Whig and Democratic parties so l
after made adhesion to the measures of bB
Administration a test of party orthodoxy. I
The Tribune doos not repent of tho policy I
that secured such results, hut "" mRy very fl
probably "" pursue it again. V
In 1852, the Whig party took up another fl
soldier, whose availability as a candidate wa- B
his military renown ; and he openly avowed fl
his concurrence in their creed, adopted at Hal fl
timore, in which they declared their determi I
nation to abide by and faithf illy carry nut the I
Legislation of 1850, which left tho Territories I
of Utah and New Mexico open to the irruption- fl
of Slavery, and provided for the reclamation I
of fcgitive slaves, at the expense of Stale Sou fl
reignty, of judicial decorum, of habeas carpi' fl
indjury trial, and secured to the S.a\e Inter- B
!8t a sway over the public council* and y<Wit B
nir.d it never before exerted. B
The man, boldly and emphatically avowing fl
lis devotion to this creed, was supported by the B
Tribune, which vas then just as nnti war and B
is Anti-Slavery as k is now. It spat upon the B
platform, and embraced him who stool upon it B
t abjured the creed, and advocated him wh< B
idopted it. Ye;i?"" we glory,"" it cries, ' in onr B
irdeat support of the candidate, in spite of the B
>latform. So it may be again ! *' B
We never had any doubt of this, hut many B
AntiySlavcry xr.cn have been deluding them- B
elves wi'h tho notion that thv Tribune, and the B
Vnti-BIavery Whigs it represents would here- B
iftcr go for independent [olibctl Anti-Slavery B
union. Wo knew better, because we under- B
tood the Principle of the Tribune's jK'liev, and H
ts Prejudices. That Principle is embodied in B
his declaration : * fl
