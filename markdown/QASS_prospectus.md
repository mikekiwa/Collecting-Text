# PROJECT OVERVIEW

[Provide 1-2 introductory paragraphs describing the proposed book, the fields/subfields it covers, its approach, and your purpose and goals in writing it. Highlight aspects of your book that will distinguish it from others currently available that deal with the same or similar topics—that it, what makes your proposed volume unique? Where relevant, explain how your proposed monograph fits in with existing titles in the QASS series.]# MARKET & COURSEBACKGROUND

# Competition
Several books are currently available that 

* Mitchell, Ryan. 2015. *Web Scraping with Python: Collecting Data from the Modern Web* O'Reilly Media, Inc. 255 pages. 
    This is an excellent book that covers much of the same material as the proposed book. It covers gathering data from the web and APIs, including both basic and more advanced techniques. *Web Scraping with Python* also covers some topics not in the proposed manuscript, such as SQL databases and text analysis. The central different between this book and the proposed book is audience and assumed knowledge. This book is primariy aimed at the Python developer community and not academic researchers. As such, it includes chapters such as, "Testing Your Website with Scrapers." More importantly, the book rushes through the destails of some things that programers are likely to be familiar with, such as CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and lambda expressions, but that the average social scientist is unfamiliar. As such, it is unlikely to be adopted by instructors in the social science.
