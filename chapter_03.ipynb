    "Most of the APIs of interest to social scientists weren't designed for our use. They are primarily for web or mobile app developers who want to include the content on their pages. So while I might use the [MapQuest](http://developer.mapquest.com) API to look at how often intra-city trips involve highways, the target audience is business owners trying to help people get to their store. Similarly, scores of researchers have used data from [Twitter APIs](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1) to study politics, but it was developed so that you could put a custom Twitter widget on your home page. \n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that since these services want you to use their data, the APIs are often well documented, especially for languages like Python that are popular in Silicon Valley. The bad news is that APIs don't always make available the parts of the service, like historical data, that are of most interest to researchers. The worst news is research using APIs frequently violates the providers Terms of Service, so it can be an ethical grey zone. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you sign up as a developer to use an API, you usually agree to only use the API to facilitate other people using the service (e.g. customer's finding their way to your store) and that you won't store the data. API providers usually enforce this through rate limiting, meaning you can only access the service so many times per minute or per day. For example, you can only search status updates 180 times every 15 minutes according to [Twitter guidelines](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/rate-limiting/1.1/limits). [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/faq) limits you to 10,000 calls per day. If you go over your limit, you won't be able to access the service for a bit. You will also get in trouble if you redistribute the data, so don't plan on doing that. "

    "Two of the major reasons that web services require API authentication is so that they know who you are and so they can make sure that you don't go over their rate limits. Since you shouldn't be giving your password to random people on the internet, API authentication works a little bit differently. Like many other places, in order to use the Yelp API you have to sign up as [developer](http://www.yelp.com/developers). After telling them a little bit about what you plan to do--feel free to be honest; they aren't going to deny you access if you put \"research on food cultures\" as the purpose--you will get a Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Token, and Token Secret. Copy and paste them somewhere special. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Yelp API goes something like this. First, you tell Yelp who you are and what you want. Assuming you are authorized to have this information, they respond with a URL where you can retrieve the data. The coding for this in practice is a little bit complicated, so there are often single use tools for accessing APIs, like [Tweepy](http://tweepy.github.io) for Twitter. \n",
    "\n",
    "There's no module to install for the Yelp API, but Yelp does provide some [sample Python code](https://github.com/Yelp/yelp-api/tree/master/v2/python). I've slightly modified the code below to show a sample search for restaurants near Chapel Hill, NC, sorted by distance. You can find more options in the search [documentation](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api). The API's search options include things like location and type of business, and allows you to sort either by distance or popularity."
